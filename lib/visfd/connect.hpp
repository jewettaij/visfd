/// @brief  This function is used for connected-component labeling.
///         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling
///         It works on binary and grayscale images, as well as images with
///         directional (and tensor) voxel features.
///
///         This function is used to identify different "islands" of bright
///         voxels separated by a sea of other voxels of low brightness
///         (...or incompatible directions, as explained below).
///         These different islands may correspond to different objects
///         in the source image.  However this function can also consider
///         voxel's vector and tensor attributes (if present).  This function
///         can decline to merge adjacent voxels into the same "island"
///         unless their directions (and tensors) are sufficiently similar.
///
/// @warning EXPERIMENTAL CODE.  THIS FUNCTION IS COMPLICATED AND THIS MAKES IT
///          DIFFICULT TO USE.  THIS FUNCTION'S ARGUMENT LIST MAY CHANGE
///          SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE.
///
/// @details   Based on the watershed algorithm, this function first
///         finds the locations of all of the local maxima in brightness (a.k.a.
///         "saliency") in the image.  These form the peaks of the islands.
///         Then, starting from these locations of high brightness, it searches
///         outwards for adjacent (neighboring) voxels which are also bright and
///         adds them to the "island".  (I sometimes call islands "clusters" or
///         "watershed basins".)  The islands continue to grow until they reach
///         voxel brightnesses (or saliencies) which fall below some threshold
///         specified by the caller.  This is the "shoreline" of the island.
///         If during this outward-search two islands collide with each other
///         they may be merged into one island.  However there is one
///         exception:  If the voxels in the image are imbued with directional
///         attributes (ie. if "aaaafDirection" or "aaaafSymmetricTensor"
///         are non-NULL), then the directions of these neighboring voxels
///         must be similar.  If the neighboring voxels from either island
///         are not pointing in sufficiently similar directions (as specified
///         by directional thresholds supplied by the caller), then the islands
///         will not be merged into one island, even if both voxels are bright.
///
///         In other words, this function performs the agglomerative clustering
///         of voxels, considering voxel direction, proximity, and brightness.
///
/// @return The function returns the number of clusters ("islands") found.
///         After the function is finished, the aaaiDest[][][] array will store
///         the cluster-ID (a.k.a. "island-ID") associated with each voxel.
///         The clusters are sorted by their size (by default), and this is
///         relfected in their cluster-ID numbers ("labels").  (The largest
///         cluster has an ID of 1.  Cluster-ID numbers begin at 1, not 0.)
///         (The "pv_cluster_maxima" argument, if != nullptr, will store
///         the location of the saliency maxima (or minima) for each cluster.)
///
/// @note   Voxels below the saliency threshold are ignored, and will
///         assigned to the value of UNDEFINED, which (by default) is -1.
///         (This value can be overridden using the "label_undefined" argument.)
///
/// @note   If a aaafMask array is supplied by the caller, then voxels located
///         in regions where aaafMask[iz][iy][ix]=0 will be ignored.
///
/// The remaining notes below describe the behavior of the optional
/// aaaafVector, aaaafSymmetricTensor, aaaafVectorStandardized arguments,
/// which are not generally useful in all situations
/// @note   If aaaafVector != nullptr, then
///         neighboring voxels whose direction (vector) changes discontinuously,
///         will not be added to an existing cluster.
/// @note   If aaaafSymmetricTensor != nullptr, then
///         neighboring voxels whose direction (tensor) changes discontinuously,
///         will not be added to an existing cluster.
/// @note   In addition, voxels whose Hessian (2nd derivative matrix) of the
///         aaafSaliency array is INCOMPATIBLE with the corresponding entry from
///         aaaafSymmetricTensor (if!=nullptr) will not be added to any cluster.
///         (Tensors are compared using the normalized Trace-product.)
/// @note   In addition, voxels whose principle eigenvector from the Hessian
///         (2nd derivative matrix) of the aaafSaliency array is POINTING IN A
///         SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM the corresponding entry from
///         the aaaafVector array (if != nullptr) will not be added to any cluster.
/// @note   If (consider_dot_product_sign == false), the difference in vector
///         directions will be calculated by considering only the magnitude
///         of the dot product between them (not the sign).
///         (This is useful because some image processing algorithms generate
///         vectors which lack polarity.  For example, planar surface "ridge"
///         detectors calculate vectors normal to a surface, which are equally
///         likely to point inward or outward.)
/// @note   If (consider_dot_product_sign == false) AND
///         if aaaafVector and aaaafVectorStandardized are both non-null, THEN
///         aaaafVectorStandardized array will store a version of aaaafVector
///         array whose signs have been flipped to preserve consistency
///         of directionality between adjacent voxels as much as possible.
///         Why?  This is necessary because some methods for generating voxel
///         directions are unable to determine the sign of each voxel's
///         direction.  (The eigenvectors of the Hessian are a good example.)
///         By supplying an "aaaafVectorStandardized" array, you can ask this
///         function to choose the sign of these vectors.  This will ensure
///         that all of the vectors in the same island are pointing
///         in directions that are locally compatible with each other.
///         Robustness: If any clusters contain any any closed loops
///         that have directions which cannot be chosen consistently,
///         they will be cut at a location where their saliency is weakest.
///         (This will avoid MÃ¶bius-strip-like defects with an odd number of
///         twists.  Since most noisy images have defects with most one twist,
///         if any, this will eliminate the vast majority of random defects.)
