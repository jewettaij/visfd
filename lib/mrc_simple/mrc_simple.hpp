/// @brief "MrcSimple": a class to read and write tomographic data.
///              (stored in .MRC and .REC files)
///
/// Tomographic data is internally stored as arrays of floats, however
/// this program can read MRC/REC files using several other numeric formats 
/// as well (including signed and unsigned 8-bit and 16-bit integers).
///
/// --- PLEASE REPORT BUGS ---
///
/// @note As of 2019-4-08, support for MRC files which are not in row-major
///       format has been implemented but has not been tested.
///       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order
///       (IE This program has only been tested on MRC files whose "mapC",
///        "mapR", and "mapS" (mapCRS[]) header data equals 1,2,3 respectively.)
///        
/// @note As of 2019-4-08, the interpretation of signed bytes (mode 0) MRC files
///       is different in IMOD, compared to other software tools, including this
///       software.  When reading files using signed bytes, IMOD adds 128 to
///       all the entries (so that the resulting numbers are strictly positive).
///       This does not occur when reading signed-byte files using this library.
///       (This software may also fail to realize when signed bytes are in use.)
///        
/// @note As of 2019-4-08, this software does not attempt to detect 
///       or convert big-endian or little-endian numbers.
///       To be on the safe side, compile this software on hardware which is
///       compatible with the hardware which was used to write the MRC file.
///       (IE intel CPUs, or ARM CPUs using the same endian settings.)
///
/// @note  Documentation on the MRC file format is available here:
/// http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/mrc_format.txt
/// http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/image-processing-software/#image
/// http://ami.scripps.edu/software/mrctools/mrc_specification.php
