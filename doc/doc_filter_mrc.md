filter_mrc
===========

**filter_mrc** is typically used for detecting
1-D **curves** and 2-D **surfaces** in 3-D images
*(using [3D tensor voting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625523))*.
*(* **WARNING:** *The detection of curves is experimental as of 2021-7-12.)*
It can also detect spherical and non-spherical **blobs** in an image.
*(Note: In this documentation, I use the words "image" and "tomogram"
interchangeably.  A tomogram is a 3-D image.)*

**filter_mrc** can be used local minima-finding,
connected-component analysis, and
[classic watershed segmentation](https://imagej.net/plugins/classic-watershed#introduction).
The coordinates of the objects that are detected can be saved to text files
for processing and refinement using popular 3rd-party software tools
(including tools for surface smoothing and surface closure).

Before objects in the image can be detected,
images often need to be processed or cleaned up beforehand.
Consequently, the *filter_mrc* program also can be used to apply some
common filters to a 3D image, and save the result as a new .mrc/.rec file.
This includes
low-pass, high-pass,
dilation, erosion,
opening, closing,
edge detectors,
ridge detectors,
thresholding,
brightness inversions,
[generalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution#Version_1)
[Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur),
[Difference-of-Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians),
[Laplacian-of-Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian),
and fluctuation (noise) detection filters.

The *filter_mrc* program can be also used as a paint program to manually modify,
edit, annotate, or erase problematic portions of existing volumetric images. 
*(Caveat: filter_mrc is text-only.  It does not have a graphical interface.)*

All operations support "masking".
An image *mask* can be used to exclude certain
voxels or regions from consideration.
(Typically these are voxels which have been characterized previously.
The contributions from remaining voxels are normalized, so that objects located
within narrow confined spaces can be detected accurately and without penalty.)
Masks can also be used to give some voxels more consideration
than others during the blurring (filtering) process.  (A.K.A. "weighting".)
In this way, you can use a mask to to apply a filter to an image
whose boundaries are smooth and gradual as opposed to jagged and rectangular,


### *Alternatives to filter_mrc*
Many of the features of **filter_mrc** are also available
from popular python libraries, including:
[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org)
and
[scipy.ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html).
MRC files can be read in python using the
[mrcfile](https://mrcfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#basic-usage)
module.



## Usage Examples:

### Example 1
```
# Detect membranes in an EM image using tensor voting
# (target thickness â‰ˆ 60.0 Angstroms)

filter_mrc -in tomogram.rec \
  -out membranes.rec \
  -membrane minima 75.0 \
  -tv 5 -tv-angle-exponent 4 -tv-best 0.12 \
  -save-progress temporary_file.rec \
  -cl -0.5 0.5
```

This searches for dark surfaces of thickness approximately 70 (Angstroms), and
creates a new image file ("membranes.rec") with the membranes emphasized.
View this file (eg. using IMOD) to see if the membranes are successfully
detected.  You may need to adjust this thickness parameter
(and the other parameters) until the membrane is clearly visible.
In my experience, 60-70 Angstroms is a reasonable default thickess parameter
to detect lipid bilayers.  Most Cryo-EM tomogram files have voxel widths
in units of Angstroms.  You can override this by specifying
the physical width of each voxel using the [-w argument](#Voxel-Width).
**This operation is extremely slow, so try this on a small,
cropped image first.**

Note: After the membrane features are detected, they must be analyzed.
This typically requires running the "filter_mrc" program again, multiple times.
The optional
["-save-progress"](#-save-progress-FILENAME)
argument used here allows us to skip the time consuming process of
detecting the membrane each time we run "filter_mrc" later on.
(See [example 3](#Example-3) below.)

Note: The computation time will be roughly proportional to the image size
*as well as* the "-tv-best" argument (which ranges from 0 to 1).
(See [example 3](#Example-3) below.)  The computation time also varies
dramatically with the voxel width.  High resolution images with small
voxels are prohibitively slow to analyze.  The software will automatically
reduce the resolution of the generated tomogram (and increase the voxel width)
to maintain reasonable performance when used to analyze tomograms
with small voxel widths.  (You can manually override this using the
[-bin N](#-bin-binsize) argument, and setting N=1.)

*(Note: Extra care must be taken if your image contains ice, gold fiducial
markers, or other extremely dark objects which can confuse the detector.
You can usually reduce the severity of this problem a little bit by including
the "-cl -0.5 0.5" argument to clip these extreme voxel brightnesses.
Better yet, you can prepare an "mask" image file which excludes
these objects from consideration.  (This can be done using the
"-thresh2" argument, or alternatively the "-blob", "-discard-blobs",
"-draw-spheres" "-foreground 0", and "-background 1" arguments.)
Then later run filter_mrc again to detect membranes using the
"-mask" argument, together with the mask image you just created.)*


### Example 2

Detect all dark blobs ("minima") which are between
190 and 300 Angstroms in width.
This corresponds to objects which are (approximately) the size of ribosomes.

```
filter_mrc -in tomogram.rec \
  -blob minima tomogram_blobs.txt 190.0 300.0 1.01

# Now discard the faint, noisy, or overlapping blobs.

filter_mrc -in tomogram.rec \
  -discard-blobs tomogram_blobs.txt tomogram_ribosomes.txt \
  -minima-threshold -70 \
  -radial-separation 0.8 \
  -mask cytoplasmic_volume.mrc   # <- optional

# Finally, create an image showing the remaining blobs we want to keep:

filter_mrc -in tomogram.rec \
  -out tomogram_ribosomes.rec \
  -draw-hollow-spheres tomogram_ribosomes.txt \
  -background-auto
```

Note:
The ["*-mask cytoplasmic_volume.rec*"](#-mask-MRC_FILE)
argument used in the second step is optional.
I use it in this example because we are searching for ribosomes,
so we want to restrict our search to blobs which lie *inside* the cell.
(The mask image file used in this example, "cytoplasmic_volume.rec",
can be generated using the procedure described in example 3.)
*(Note: Extra care must be taken if your image contains ice, gold fiducial
markers, or other extremely dark objects which can confuse the detector
You can usually reduce the severity of this problem a little by including the
"-cl -0.5 0.5" argument to clip these extreme voxel brightnesses.)*


Note:
All of these parameters make reasonable
defaults for ribosome detection except the
["*-minima-thresold*"](#Automatic-disposal-of-poor-scoring-blobs)
parameter ("-70" in the example).
It must be chosen carefully because it will vary from image to image.
(Strategies for choosing this parameter are discussed
[below](#automatic-disposal-of-poor-scoring-blobs).
*Alternatively,* it can be determined automatically using the
["*-auto-thresh*"](#-auto-thresh-score--supervised-file_accepttxt-file_rejecttxt)
argument.



### Example 3

Find the **largest membrane** in an image,
and **generate a closed surface** for that membrane.
(This example requires
 [*SSDRecon*](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon) and
 [*meshlab*](http://www.meshlab.net).)

This is a complicated example with several steps.
In order for this to work, you must make sure you are able to detect the
membrane first.  To do that, first try the procedure in [example 1](#Example-1)
on your tomogram.  Try that on a small cropped image.
View the newly created image, and if the membranes are clearly visible.
If so, then you are ready to try the example below.
(If not, adjust the -membrane thickness parameter.)

```
filter_mrc -in tomogram.rec \
  -load-progress temporary_file.rec \
  -out membranes_clusters.rec \
  -connect 1.0e+09 -connect-angle 15 \
  -select-cluster 1 -normals-file largest_membrane_pointcloud.ply
```
Note:
Here I assumed that the user has already followed the instructions in
[example 1](#Example-1).  (Consequently, to save time, we used the
["-load-progress"](#-load-progress-FILENAME)
to argument to skip over the time consuming
process of detecting the membrane again.)
This will generate a new file ("largest_membrane_pointcloud.ply")
containing a list of points located on the largest surface. You can use
[*SSDRecon*](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon)
to load this file and close the holes in the surface:
```
SSDRecon --in largest_membrane_pointcloud.ply \
  --out largest_membrane.ply --depth 12 --scale 2.0
```
This does not always succeed.  You can visualize the result using:
```
meshlab largest_membrane.ply
```
*(Note: If "SSDRecon" fails, try "PoissonRecon" instead.  Both programs
accept the same arguments and are
[distributed together](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon).)*

The resulting *(hopefully)* closed surface (eg. "largest_membrane.ply")
can be visualized in [*meshlab*](http://www.meshlab.net), smoothed
(for example, by iteratively using
"Filters"->"Smoothing"->"HC Laplacian Smooth"),
and later voxelized using [voxelize_mesh.py](doc_voxelize_mesh.md):
```
voxelize_mesh.py -m largest_membrane.ply -i tomogram.rec -o segmented.rec
```
**(WARNING: [Use ulimit beforehand.](doc_voxelize_mesh.md)**)
This newly created image file (eg. "segmented.rec") is a segmented 3D image,
indicating which voxels belong to the interior of the closed surface.
(These voxels could correspond to a cell's cytoplasm
 or an organelle within the cell, for example.)
This new image can then be used as a mask for future
image processing, allowing you to segment the contents of the cell
or segment concentric compartments inside larger compartments
(eg. organelles inside cells).

Keep in mind that the file "segmented.rec" includes voxels extending
all the way to the center of the membrane boundary.  Hence, some of
these voxels at the surface are actually part of the membrane itself.
We can optionally cleanup of the segmented volume to exclude voxels
that are too close to the membrane surface.
The [-erosion](#-erosion-thickness) 
argument will contract the boundary of a segmented
surface by approximately 50.0 Angstroms inward,
creating a new file "segmented_interior.rec".
```
filter_mrc -i segmented.rec -o segmented_interior.rec -erosion 50.0
```
(You will have to play with this distance parameter, eg "50.0"
to see what works best.)



**Note:**
All of these parameters make reasonably good
defaults for membrane detection except the
["**-connect**"](#-connect-threshold)
parameter ("1.0e+09" in the example).
It must be chosen carefully because it will vary from image to image.
Use the "-load-progress FILENAME" argument to save time
while experimenting with different thresholds.
Strategies for choosing this parameter are discussed
[below](#determining-the--connect-threshold-parameter).
If a suitable parameter can not be found, you can also use the
["**-must-link**"](#-must-link-FILE)
argument to manually force connections between
disconnected regions. (See below.)
You can also *modify* the image to erase or mask problematic regions (using the
[-draw-spheres](#-draw-spheres-filename), or
[-mask-rect-subtract](#-mask-rect-subtract-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax), and
[-mask-sphere-subtract](#-mask-sphere-subtract-x0-y0-z0-r) arguments).

Note:
If the resulting surface is *not closed*,
then try increasing the "--scale" parameter.


## WARNING: Use *ulimit*
Some operations, such as tensor-voting and voxelization, consume a large
amount of memory.  Consequently, I recommend using the 
[ulimit -v SIZE_IN_KB](https://ss64.com/bash/ulimit.html)
command to prevent system lockup, especially if you are on a shared computer.
(If my understanding is correct, running "ulimit -v 14000000" beforehand
should prevent programs like filter_mrc from consuming more than 14Gb of RAM.)

If you are not able to run *ulimit* (for example, if you don't have
administrator/sudo priveleges), then just use caution.
In that case, run a system monitor (like "top") in another window.
Then, when you run *filter_mrc* or *voxelize_mesh.py*, be prepared to kill that
program if it uses more than 80% of the system memory.


## Arguments:

### Input and Output files

The user must specify the name of the tomogram they wish to process using the
"-in" argument:
```
   -in SOURCE_FILE.rec
```
(Note: **Files can end in ".mrc"** instead of ".rec".
 *Alternatively,* the user can start with a **blank image**
 by specifying the "**-image-size nx ny nz**" argument.
 This can be useful when you are using filter_mrc to
 calculate something that no longer needs to know what
 the original image looks like.)

Users must specify the name of the new tomogram
(created by applying the filter to the original tomogram)
using the "-out" argument:
```
   -out DESTINATION_FILE.rec
```


### Voxel Width

*By default, all of the parameters provided by the user
are assumed to be in **physical units**.  (Eg. *Angstroms*, not *voxels*.)
This makes it more convenient to apply the software
to images at different magnifications.
(This includes all of the width parameters used with the
 "-gauss", "-blob", "-dog", "-draw-spheres", and "-template-gauss" filters.)

Consequently, this program needs to know the physical width of each voxel.
By default it will attempt to infer that from the MRC file
*(which are typically stored in units of Angstroms, not nm)*.
If you have a more accurate estimate of the voxel width,
you can specify it using the "**-w**" argument:
```
   -w voxelwidth
```
The "-w" argument will override the voxel widths
specified in the MRC file.

Setting voxelwidth to 1 using "-w 1"
will allow you to enter distance parameters in units of voxels.

*(In the Jensen Lab tomography database, there is typically
 a ~10% difference between the voxel width stored in the
 MRC file, and the voxel width stored at the
 corresponding entry in the tomography database.
 The later is more accurate.)*



## A Short Description of Each Filter Type:

Again, this program is most frequently used for detecting
2-D **surfaces**, 1-D **curves**, and point-like **blobs** in images.


- The ["**-membrane**"](#Detecting-membranes)
argument is used to detect thin, membrane-like structures using
[3D ridge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_detection)
- The ["**-edge**"](#-edge-thickness) argument is used to detect
surfaces at the edge of light-dark regions
*(<- WARNING: FEATURE NOT TESTED. 2021-7-12)*
- The ["**-curve**"](#Detecting-curves) argument is used to detect thin curves.
*(<- WARNING: FEATURE NOT TESTED. 2021-7-12)*.
The fidelity of these three detectors can be improved by using
a method known as [3D tensor voting](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~gerig/CS7960-S2010/handouts/Slides-tensorVoting-Zhe-Leng.pdf)
using the ["**-tv**"](#-tv-Ïƒ_ratio) argument.
Voxels belonging to individual surfaces or curves
can be grouped together using using the
["**-connect**"](#-connect-threshold) argument.
Voxels belonging to the same surface can be analyzed and their locations
and orientations can be saved to a file for further analysis using the
["**-normals-file**"](#-normals-file-PLY_FILE)
argument.
- The
["**-blob**"](#Blob-detection)
,
["**-blob-r**"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest),
and
["**-blob-s**"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest)
arguments can be used for
[scale-free blob detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian).
Objects in the image of various sizes can be detected using this filter.
Several strategies for
[Non-max suppression](#Non-max-suppression:-automatic-disposal-of-blobs)
are provided.

All of these detection algorithms can be quite slow.
Several strategies to reduce computation time are described below,
including cropping and [binning](#-bin-binwidth) your 3-D image (tomogram).



Other, simpler filters and operations are also provided



The
["**-dilation**"](#-dilate-thickness),
["**-erosion**"](#-erosion-thickness),
["**-dilation-gauss**"](#-dilate-thickness), and
["**-erosion-gauss**"](#-erosion-thickness)
filters are used for
[enlarging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)) or
[shrinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology))
the bright regions in an image.
The
["**-opening**"](#-opening-thickness)
["**-closing**"](#-closing-thickness)
filters are used for the removal of small
[bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology))
or
[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_(morphology))
features from an image.


The [-bin](#-bin-binwidth) argument can be used to reduce the size
and resolution of the image through binning.


The
["**-gauss**"](#-gauss-and--ggauss)
filter applies a simple (low-pass)
[Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur)
filter to your image.
(The
["**-gauss-aniso**"](#-gauss-and--ggauss)
filter allows you to apply different amounts of blurring to the X,Y, and Z directions.)
[Generalized Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution#Version_1) are supported.


The
["**-dog**""](#-dog)
filter uses a
[Difference-Of-Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians)
filter which can be used as a frequency band-pass filter (for high and/or low frequency removal).
(The
["**-dog-aniso**"](#-dog)
filter allows you to modify the properties of the filter in the X,Y,Z directions.  Filter sharpness can be customized using the
["-exponents"](#-dogg)
argument.)
[Generalized Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution#Version_1) are supported.


The
["**-fluct**"](#-fluct-and--fluct-aniso)
and
["**-fluct-aniso**"](#-fluct-and--fluct-aniso)
filters calculate the magnitude of
the voxel intensity fluctuations relative to their local surroundings.
They can be used to find locations in the image where the brightness
remains relatively constant or fluctuates wildly.  It can also be useful
for characterizing regions within the image that have poor contrast.


The
["**-find-minima**"](#-find-minima-and--find-maxima)
and
["**-find-maxima**"](#-find-minima-and--find-maxima)
arguments will find all of the local
intensity minima and maxima respectively in the image.
The user has the option to discard poor scoring minima or maxima,
or minima and maxima which are too close together
using
[non-max suppression](#Non-max-suppression:-automatic-disposal-of-minima-or-maxima).


The
["**-watershed**"](#-watershed-type)
argument will generate a new image which has been
segmented using the
[classic watershed](https://imagej.net/plugins/classic-watershed#introduction)
algorithm.


The
["**-invert**"](#-invert)
filter exchanges bright and dark voxels.
The ["**-rescale**"](#-rescale-m-b)
filter allows you to shift (offset) and rescale voxel brightnesses arbitrarily.
The
["**-thresh**"](#-thresh-threshold),
["**-thresh-interval**"](#-thresh-interval-in_a-in_b)
["**-thresh2**"](#-thresh2-thresh_a-thresh_b),
["**-thresh4**"](#-thresh4-thresh01_a-thresh01_b-thresh10_a-thresh10_b),
and
["**-clip**"](#-clip-a-b)
filters are used to use clip voxel intensities and to select voxels
whose intensities lie within in a range specified by the user.




# Feature detection

## Detecting surfaces

### -membrane type thickness

If the "**-membrane**" filter is selected, the program will detect
thin membrane-like surfaces which are either brighter or darker
than their surroundings.
The "*type*" argument must be either "*minima*" or "*maxima*".
If *type* = "*minima*", then this filter will detect thin membrane-like
structures which are dark on a bright background.
If *type* = "*maxima*", then this filter will detect membrane-like
structures which are bright on a dark background.
The *thickness* parameter should be a number indicating
the approximate target *thickness* for the thin membrane-like feature
you are interested in detecting.
(This parameter should be expressed in physical units, not voxels.
Membranes whose thickness within a factor of 2 of this target
are also likely to be detected.
*Technically, the "thickness" parameter controls the width Gaussian, Ïƒ,
that will be initially convolved with the original image, according to
Ïƒ=thickness/âˆš3.  For details, see
[Steger IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Machine Int. 1998](https://doi.org/10.1109/34.659930).*)

The *output* of this filter will be bright wherever the derivative of
the brightness varies much more rapidly in one direction than it does
in the two orthogonal directions.
Because this filter depends on second derivatives, it is prone to also
detect a large number of unwanted spurious fluctuations in brightness.
Tensor-voting (using the [**-tv**](#-tv-Ïƒ_ratio) argument)
can be used to remove these spurious detected peaks
and greatly improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

Groups of connected voxels that belong to the same surface can be
identified using the [**-connect**](#-connect-threshold) argument,
and their locations can be saved to a simple text file for geometric
analysis using the
[**-normals-file**](#-normals-file-PLY_FILE) argument.

**WARNING**
*This filter requires a very large amount of memory
(enough to store at least 9 copies of the original image in 32bit-float mode).*




#### Detection and masking

You may wish to ignore certain voxels which are not part of the region
that you want to consider.
This can reduce the computation time.
In some cases, it can also improve detection accuracy.
You can do this using the ["**-mask**"](#-mask-MRC_FILE) argument
and [other similar arguments](#Masking).

You can use an image mask during the initial stages of detection
(for example, using the [-membrane](#-membrane-type-thickness),
[-curve](#-curve-type-thickness),
[-edge](#-edge-thickness), and
[-tv](#-tv-Ïƒ_ratio) arguments).
However since detection is very sensitive to noise near the mask boundary,
it may be better to refrain from using a mask until later on,
(for example, when using the 
[-connect](#-connect-threshold) and
["-normals-file"](#-normals-file-PLY_FILE)
arguments).  Otherwise, you may detect many faint, minor objects or spurious
noise near this boundary instead of the surface or curve that you are seeking.
Alternatively, to get around this problem you can dilate (expand) the size
of the mask region to include these voxels near the periphery.
*(One way to do this is using the 
[-dilation](#-dilation-thickness) or
[-dilation-gauss](#-dilation-gauss-thickness)
arguments with a large thickness parameter.  This is discussed below.
Alternatively, if your only goal is to reduce the computation time, you can
use the [-mask-rect](#-mask-rect-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax) and
[-mask-sphere](#-mask-sphere-x0-y0-z0-r) arguments to create a mask
region large enough to enclose the object of interest.)*

It may also help to vary the *size of the region* in the mask file using 
[erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology)) or
[dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)).
(If you are using the "-mask" argument to load a mask image file,
you can do this by creating a new mask file using *filter_mrc* again with the
[-erosion](#-erosion-thickness),
[-dilation](#-dilation-thickness),
[-erosion-gauss](#-erosion-gauss-thickness), or
[-dilation-gauss](#-dilation-gauss-thickness) arguments.)
Eroding the mask can elimate traces of any structure at the edge
of the mask boundary that might otherwise confuse or distract the detector.
But, as mentioned earlier, dilating the mask is frequently more effective
at improving the detection accuracy near the mask boundary.

For noisy or cluttered images, you may have to experiment with all of these
options to maximize the chance of success.


### -edge thickness

***WARNING: THIS FEATURE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AND PROBABLY DOES NOT WORK
2021-7-12***

If the "**-edge**" filter is selected, the program will
attempt to detect the sharp boundary surfaces between
light regions and a dark volumetric regions in the image.
(This filter detects gradients in image brightness.)
Unfortunately real images are noisy.  Typical images will have many spurious
bumps which must be filtered or smoothed away before edge detection begins.
Consequently the user must specify a *thickness* argument which indicates
amount of smoothing to use to erase features that you wish to ignore
*before* the boundary (gradient) of the image is detected.
This means that light or dark patches in the image which are
smaller than *thickness* will not be visible to the edge-detector.
Using a larger *thickness* will reduce the noise in the image, but may also
smooth over small (high-frequency) features in boundary surface
that you want to detect.

As with **-membrane** argument, the edge detection fidelity
can be improved using tensor voting (with the [-tv](#-tv-Ïƒ_ratio) argument).

(Unless the ["-w 1"](#Voxel-Width) argument was specified, then
the *thickness* parameter should be in units of physical distance,
such as Angstroms, not in voxels.)

**WARNING**
*This filter requires a very large amount of memory
(enough to store at least 9 copies of the original image in 32bit-float mode).*

#### edge detection and masking
It is recommended that you refrain from using any of the "-mask" arguments
***during*** edge detection.
See [here](#Detection-and-masking) for alternative strategies.



## Detecting curves

### -curve type thickness

***WARNING: THIS FEATURE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AND PROBABLY DOES NOT WORK
2021-7-12***

When the **-curve** argument is specified, the program will
seek out thin curvy line like features in the image.
These features are long in one direction, and short in the other two directions.
The detection of (linear, filamentous) curves
in images is much like the detection of surfaces.
(Both detectors use
[3D ridge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_detection).)
As with the **-membrane** argument, the user must specify
the *type* of the curve, which can be either "*maxima*" or "*minima*",
depending on whether the curve is bright with a dark background,
or dark with a bright background, respectively.
The user must *also* specify the approximate *thickness*
of the curve (in physical units).
(Curves which are thicker than this will not be detected.)

*As with surface detection, the curve detection fidelity
can be improved using tensor voting (with the [-tv](#-tv-Ïƒ_ratio) argument).*

(Unless the ["-w 1"](#Voxel-Width) argument was specified,
the *thickness* parameter should be in units of physical distance,
such as Angstroms, not in voxels.)
Also see the documentation for the [-membrane](#-membrane-type-thickness)
argument.

**WARNING**
*This filter requires a very large amount of memory
(enough to store at least 9 copies of the original image in 32bit-float mode).*

#### curve detection and masking
It is recommended that you refrain from using any of the "-mask" arguments
***during*** curve detection.
See [here](#Detection-and-masking) for alternative strategies.



### -tv Ïƒ_ratio
The "**-tv**" argument enables refinement of (*-membrane*) results using
[3D tensor voting](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~gerig/CS7960-S2010/handouts/Slides-tensorVoting-Zhe-Leng.pdf).
It performs a kind of directional blurring which reinforces regions in the image
where detected ridges in the image point in the same or similar directions.
(For a nice visual demonstration, see
[these slides](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~gerig/CS7960-S2010/handouts/Slides-tensorVoting-Zhe-Leng.pdf).)
The *Ïƒ_ratio* argument is a number larger than 1 which controls the distance
over which this blurring occurs.
A larger *Ïƒ_ratio* argument dramatically reduces the influence of noise
in the original image, at the cost of blurring away small features that
you wish to detect.
It is typically between 4.0 and 7.0.
(See technical details below.)
Tensor voting is a very effective method to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio when detecting curves and surfaces.
Tensor-voting refinement is not done by default
because it can be a very expensive computation.
Because the speed of the algorithm grows rapidly with the *Ïƒ_ratio* argument,
users sometimes start with a small parameter (like 4.0) and increase it
if necessary.

Note: The tensor-voting algorithm used (as a result of using the "-tv" argument)
is **extremely slow**.  Croping the tomogram and/or reducing the resolution
of the 3D image (using the ["-bin"](#-bin-binsize) argument)
will dramatically reduce computation time.  This recommended
when you are in the early stages of learning to use this feature.

Typically, once you have detected the surfaces (or curves) in an image, you
will probably want to analyze them to stitch together larger surfaces.
This is usually an iterative process and it
requires running the "filter_mrc" program multiple times.
Consequenly, **it is strongly recommended that you use the
["-save-progress"](#-save-progress-FILENAME)
argument,** the first time you use the **-tv** argument,
so that you don't need to repeat the slow tensor-voting calculation each time.

*(Note: -tv is not an independent filter.
It enables refinement of existing results from the
"-membrane", "-edge", and "-curve" filters.
Hence, the "-tv" argument is ignored unless one of these
three filters has been selected.)

*(Technical details: The width of the Gaussian used in the radial-decay
function used in tensor voting has a width of
Ïƒ_tv = Ïƒ_ratio â¨‰ Ïƒ,
where "Ïƒ" is the *thickess* parameter specified in the
[-membrane](#-membrane-type-thickness),
[-edge](#-edge-thickness),
or
[-curve](#-curve-type-thickness), arguments
The *Ïƒ_ratio* parameter has a value of 1/âˆš3.)*


### -tv-angle-exponent n
*(This argument is optional.)*
The "**-tv-angle-exponent**" parameter (*n*)
controls the penalty applied to membrane-like regions which are pointing
in incompatible directions.  It is 4 by default.


### -tv-truncate-ratio ratio
*(This argument is optional.)*
The "**-tv-truncate-ratio**" parameter (*ratio*) is the distance
(in units *Ïƒ_tv*) over which tensor votes are cast. (It is âˆš2 by default.
Increasing this number will slow down the calculation considerably,
but may result in a modest increase in detection sensitivity.)


### -detection-threshold threshold
*(This argument is optional.)*
This will discard voxels whose
[saliency](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/16/opencv-saliency-detection)
(ie. membrane-ness after ridge detection)
falls below *threshold*.
This will make subsequent steps in the calculation
**(such as tensor voting)** faster.
Users can choose this threshold by running **filter_mrc** using only
the "-membrane" filter argument, and then visualizing the resulting file.
*(In IMOD, you can click on the image and
 select the "Edit"->"Point"->"Value" menu option to
 see the saliency of voxels of interest.)*

In practice, it is often easier to use the
[*-tv-best**](#-tv-best-fraction)
argument, because no intermediate visualization step is required.


### -tv-best fraction

*(This argument is optional.)*
The vast majority of voxels in an image do not resemble the feature you are
searching for (ie membranes).  The "-tv-best" argument will discard all but the
most salient voxels in the image.  It discards voxels from future consideration
unless their
[saliency](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/16/opencv-saliency-detection)
is in the top *fraction* of all of the voxel saliencies from the entire image
(excluding masked voxels, if applicable).
This will significantly reduce the computation needed
for any subsequent steps in the calculation
**(such as tensor voting)**
by a factor which is roughly proportional to this number.
The *fraction* parameter should lie in the range from 0 to 1.
(This number is 0.05 by default.
Using *0.05* is a conservative choice, but you can often get away
with using lower values.  If the resulting surfaces are incomplete, it may help to increase this number and try again.)



## -save-progress FILENAME
## -load-progress FILENAME

These two optional arguments work together to minimize the amount of time users
must spend redundantly waiting for slow operations (tensor voting) to complete.
The "-save-progress" argument will create 6 temporary files
(whose name begins with FILENAME and
ends with "_tensor_1.rec", ...,  "_tensor_6.rec").
This is useful because the process of stitching together a closed
membrane surface (or a continuous filamentous curve)
typically involves many iterations of trial and error,
using different thresholds and constraints until the
resulting surface (or curve) is reasonable.
If we use "-save-progress", then we can skip the time consuming
process of running tensor-voting each time.
We can do this using the "-load-progress FILENAME" argument.
The *FILENAME* argument should match the argument
you used with "-save-progress" earlier.
Be warned that files generated by "-save-progress" will consume
a substantial amount of disk space.  You should delete them eventually.




## Blob detection


### -blob,  -blob-r,  -blob-s

The "**-blob**",
["**-blob-r**"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest),
and
["**-blob-s**"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest)
arguments are used for
[Scale-Free Blob-Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection).
When this is used, the program will apply a LoG filter to the image
multiple times using a range of Gaussian widths (Ïƒ) (specified by the user)
in an attempt to determine the correct size (scale) for the relevant objects
in the image automatically.  (As such, this operation is comparatively slow.)
A list of local minima and maxima in *X,Y,Z* space (and scale-space)
will generated and saved in a file, using the method described in:
Lindeberg,T., Int. J. Comput. Vision., 30(2):77-116, (1998)

The "**-blob**",
["**-blob-r**"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest),
and
["**-blob-s**"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest)
filters are followed
by 5 arguments (whose meaning depends on the filter selected):
```
  -blob   type  file_name  d_min  d_max  gratio
  -blob-r type  file_name  r_min  r_max  gratio
  -blob-s type  file_name  Ïƒ_min  Ïƒ_max  gratio
```
The "**type**" argument must be either "*minima*", "*maxima*", or "*all*".
*(It's meaning is explained in detail below.
  For nearly all CryoEM images, it is safe to use "minima".)*

The "**file_name**" argument is the name of a text file which will store
a list of detected blobs.  The format of this file is explained below.

If "**-blob**" is selected, then the **d_min** and **d_max** parameters
(3rd and 4th parameters), specify a range of diameters
of the objects that you wish to detect.
(Simlarly,
["-blob-r"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest)
allows the user to specify blob sizes in terms of their radii.)
Either way, a LoG filter will be applied to the image using a series of
different Gaussians whose widths (Ïƒ) vary between "**Ïƒ_min**", and "**Ïƒ_max**".
In this series, each successive Gaussian width (Ïƒ) will be larger than the
previous one by a factor of (no larger than) "**gratio**",
a number which should be > 1.
(**1.01** is a safe choice for **gratio**,
 but you can speed up the calculation by increasing this parameter.
 Values as high as 1.1 are not uncommon.)
(Note that: *Ïƒ_min*, and *Ïƒ_max* are equal to *d_min/(2âˆš3)* and *d_max/(2âˆš3)*,
 or *r_min/âˆš3* and *r_max/âˆš3*, respectively.
 If you prefer, you can use the
 ["*-blob-s*"](#Specifying-the-radius-or-Gaussian-sigma-parameters-for-the-objects-of-interest)
 argument to directly specify the
 range of Gaussian widths you wish to use"*Ïƒ_min*", and "*Ïƒ_max*".)
After applying the LoG filter, if a voxel in the image is a (scale-adjusted)
local maxima (or minima) in *x,y,z,* and *Ïƒ*,
*then* its location and size will be recorded in a file.
"**file_name**" is the name of a file which will store these
locations of all the blobs detected in the image
as well as their sizes and scores (see below).
These detected blobs are either local minima or maxima in
X,Y,Z,[scale-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_difference_of_Gaussians_approach).
Each file is a 5-column ascii text file with the following format:
```
x1 y1 z1 diameter1 score1
x2 y2 z2 diameter2 score2
 :  :  :   :     :
xM yM zM diameterM scoreM
```
...where
"**M**" is the number of blobs (maxima or minima) which were detected,
On each line of that file,
**x,y,z** are the coordinates for the blob's center,
**diameter** is the diameter of the blob (which equals (2âˆš3)Ïƒ),
and **score** is the intensity of that voxel after
a (scale-adjusted) LoG filter of that size was applied to it.
For *minima* type blobs, the list is ordered
from low score (most negative) to high score score
For *maxima* type blobs, the list is ordered from high score to low score.
These blobs can be visualized using the "**-draw-spheres**" argument
(see below).

#### Blob types

The first argument indicates the **type** blob that the user wants to detect.
(The **type** is the 1st argument following the "-blob" argument.)
It must be one of the following choices:

|   type   | meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| *minima* | detect dark blobs on a bright background |
| *maxima* | detect bright blobs on a darker background |
|  *all*   | detect both dark and bright blobs |

Note: If **type** is set to *all*, then two different files will be generated
whose names will end in ".minima.txt" and ".maxima.txt", respectively.


#### Blob detection and masking

It is recommended that you refrain from specifying a mask
*during* the process of blob detection
(for example, by using the
["**-mask**"](#-mask-MRC_FILE)
argument).
This is because the detector is more sensitive to noise in the image
near the mask boundary (or image boundary).
Instead, it is recommended that you use the
"-mask" argument *later on, after you have finished blob detection*.
(This was shown in [example 2](#Example-2) above.)

Sometimes you might want to use the "-mask" argument during blob detection
because it can accelerate the search for blobs (by ignoring voxels outside
the mask). However don't do this if you care about blobs near the periphery.
Alternatively, to get around this problem you can dilate (expand) the size
of the mask region to include these voxels near the periphery.
*(One way to do this is using the
[-dilation](#-dilation-thickness) or
[-dilation-gauss](#-dilation-gauss-thickness) arguments.)*


#### Non-max suppression: automatic disposal of blobs

***By default, all minima and maxima are
reported during blob detection
(no matter how insignificant).***
Unfortunately, the blob-detector will typically
an enormous number of blobs in a typical image.
(Running a blob detector on some Electron-Cryotomography
 images can result in tens of millions of spurious blobs.)
The *vast majority* of these detected blobs are either
not relevant due to noise in the source image, or are overlapping.
You can discard these blobs *during* the blob detection process
using the arguments below.
However, because blob-detection is slow,
it is recommended that you save all of these blobs to a file.
*Then* you can decide which of these blobs are meaningful
by running non-max suppression later on (as shown below).
Then you can run "filter_mrc" a third time using the
["**-draw-spheres**"](#-draw-spheres-filename)
argument to visualize the remaining blobs you did not throw away.
(This is what we did in [example 2](#Example-2).)
Sometimes several iterations of non-max suppression followed by visualization
are needed before you achieve visually pleasing results.

Details are provided below explaining how visualize these blobs
(using the
[**-draw-spheres**](#-draw-spheres-filename)
 argument),
as well as how to discard low-quality and overlapping blobs
(using the
[**-discard-blobs**](#-discard-blobs),
[**-radial-separation**](#Automatic-disposal-of-overlapping-blobs),
[**-max-volume-overlap**](#Automatic-disposal-of-overlapping-blobs),
and
[**-max-volume-overlap-small**](#Automatic-disposal-of-overlapping-blobs)
arguments).

#### Recommendation:

Blob-detection is computationally expensive,
but it only has to be performed once.
Typically, users will perform blob detection with the default (permissive)
score thresholds, so that they keep all of the blobs detected
(no matter how small or insignificant).
Then later, they will run **filter_mrc** again using *either* the
[**-discard-blobs**](#-discard-blobs),
["*-auto-thresh*"](#-auto-thresh-score--supervised-file_accepttxt-file_rejecttxt)
argument, *or* the
[**-minima-threshold**](#Automatic-disposal-of-poor-scoring-blobs)
(or
[**-maxima-threshold**](#Automatic-disposal-of-poor-scoring-blobs)
[**-draw-spheres**](#-draw-spheres-filename)
arguments, perhaps several times with different thresholds)
...to decide which of these blobs are worth keeping.



# Morphology

### -erosion thickness
### -dilation thickness

These arguments will apply a *grayscale*
[image dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)) and
[image erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology))
filter to your image.  This will enlarge the
[bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)#Grayscale_dilation)
or
[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology)#Grayscale_erosion)
regions in the image appear by a distance of *thickness*, respectively
(which is in physical units, not voxels, unless the
[-w 1](#Voxel-Width) argument is used).
*(Details: A flat spherical structure-factor with radius=thickness is used.)*

Image dilation and erosion are useful for erasing or emphasizing
features (or noise) in the image that are in a given size range.
Dilation and erosion are also very useful to modify an image that
you eventually intend to use with the "-mask" argument
(in a future invocation of filter_mrc).
Recall that a *mask image* is a 3-D image used with the
["**-mask**"](#-mask-MRC_FILE) argument.
The brightness value of each voxel in a mask image is typically either 0 or 1
*(depending on whether the voxel is supposed to be
ignored or considered during subsequent calculations)*.

***WARNING:*** Dilation and erosion are slow for large *thickness* parameters.
These filters have not been optimized for speed.

If you have a binary image (images whose voxels have brightnesses 
in the range from 0 to 1), you can try using the
[-dilation-gauss](#-dilation-gauss-thickness) and
[-erosion-gauss](#-erosion-gauss-thickness)
arguments.
(These fast filters are insensitive to small features in the image.)
*(For additional morphological filter operations, see
[binary_dilate](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.morphology.html?highlight=skeletonize#skimage.morphology.binary_dilation)
[binary_erode](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.morphology.html?highlight=skeletonize#skimage.morphology.binary_erosion)
from
[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org),
along with the
[mrcfile](https://mrcfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#basic-usage)
module.)*


### -opening thickness
### -closing thickness

These arguments will apply a *grayscale*
[image opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)) and
[image closing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_(morphology))
filter to your image.
The morphological opening of an image is defined as an
[erosion followed by a dilation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.morphology.html#skimage.morphology.opening).
*(Similarly, the closing is defind by dilation followed by erosion.)*
Opening removes small bright regions, while closing removes dark holes.
The size of the objects removed is determined by the *thickness* parameter
(which is in physical units, not voxels, unless the
[-w 1](#Voxel-Width) argument is used).
*(Details: A flat spherical structure-factor with radius=thickness is used.)*
These operations have not been optimized for speed.


### -white-top-hat thickness
### -black-top-hat thickness

*(WARNING: This feature has not been tested. -Andrew 2021-7-14)*

These arguments will apply a *grayscale*
[top-hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology))
transform to your image.
Recall that the opening and closing filters remove small objects from an image.
For comparison, the top-hat transforms remove large features.
The white top-hat transform removes large bright objects on a dark background.
The black top-hat transform removes large dark objects on a bright background.
The size of the objects preserved is determined by the *thickness* parameter
(which is in physical units, not voxels, unless the
[-w 1](#Voxel-Width) argument is used).
These transforms have not been optimized for speed.

*Note: As an alternative, you can also use a
[difference-of-gaussians](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians)
filter to remove low frequencies from an image.  To do that use the
[-dog a b](#-dog) argument, setting a=0, and setting b to
a distance which is similar to a distance which is smaller than
the size of the large objects that you want removed from the image
(in physical distance units, not in voxels).*


### -dilation-gauss thickness
### -erosion-gauss thickness

These filters are an alternative implementation of
[image dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)) and
[image erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology))
that uses fast Gaussian filters to blur an image followed by thresholding.

*Note: These arguments are only intended for use with binary images
(images whose voxels have brightnesses of either 0 or 1).*
For binary images containing large smooth regions of bright voxels,
the **-dilation-gauss** and **-erosion-gauss** arguments
will enlarge or shrink the size of these bright regions
by a distance of roughly *thickness* (which has units of
physical distance unless the ["-w 1"](#Voxel-Width) argument is used).
Note that, due to blurring, features in the image which are smaller or
narrower than *thickness* will be lost after this operation is completed.
This generally producing a smoother result,
and avoids the sometimes undesirable sensitivity
to noise and small blemishes that ordinary
[dilation](#-dilation-sphere-thickness) and
[erosion](#-erosion-sphere-thickness) filters can suffer from.
However, this blurring makes these filters unsuitable
for some morphological tasks *(such as 
[opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)),
[closing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_(morphology)), and the
[top-hat transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-hat_transform))*.
Use with caution.

#### Details
This is implemented by blurring the image, and then applying a threshold
so that all voxels whose brightness are below a threshold are discarded.

- "-dilation-gauss *thickness*" is equivalent to
"-gauss *thickness* -thresh 0.157299", *(where 0.157299 â‰ˆ 1-erf(1))*
- "-erosion-gauss *thickness*" is equivalent to
"-gauss *thickness* -thresh 0.842701", *(where 0.842701 â‰ˆ erf(1))*

These thresholds were chosen so that the selected region
expands or shrinks by a distance of *thickness*.
(Technically, this is only true near a flat boundary.)


### -dilation-binary-soft r1 r2 bmax
### -erosion-binary-soft r1 r2 bmax

These arguments will perform a graycale
[dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_(morphology)#Grayscale_dilation) and
[erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology)#Grayscale_erosion).
Unlike traditional dilation and erosion operations which have a hard distance
cutoff, this version has a cutoff that varies gradually from *r1* to *r2*.
(Unless the "-w 1" argument is used, both *r1* and *r2* are expressed in
units of physical distance, not voxels.  *Special case: If r2=0*,
a soft edge is used which is only 1-voxel wide.)

***Note:*** These "binary-soft" arguments are only intended for use with
*binary* images or grayscale images whose voxels have brightness
in the range from *0* to *bmax*.  (Typically *bmax=1*.)

*(Technical details: This version uses a soft spherical structure factor,
*b(r)* that varies from *0*, when *r=r1*, up to to *-bmax*, when
*r=r2*, and -âˆž, when *r>r2*.  Setting *r2=0* results in a
spherical structure factor whose brightness varies from *0* to *-bmax*
on a thin 1-voxel wide shell at the sphere's boundary.)*


### -find-minima and -find-maxima

Usage:
```
  -find-minima  filename
```
or
```
  -find-maxima  filename
```
The **-find-minima** and **-find-maxima** arguments will
create a file containing the locations of the where the voxel brightness is either a local minima or maxima, respectively.
A "minima" is defined as one or more connected voxels
(of identical brightness), surrounded on all sides by neighbors of higher brightness.
(See below for details about which voxels are considered *"neighbors"*.)

This will generate a text file indicating the location of the minima.
This file is a 5-column ascii text file.
Each file is a 5-column ascii text file with the following format:
```
x1 y1 z1 numVoxels1 brightness1
x2 y2 z2 numVoxels2 brightness2
 :  :  :   :     :
xM yM zM numVoxelsM brightnessM
```
The x,y,z coordinates of each minima or maxima are in the first 3 columns,
followed by the number of voxels in the maxima or minima (which is usually 1), and finally
it's "score" (which is the brightness of the voxel at that location).
*(This format is nearly identical to the format used by the
  "-blob",  "-blob-r",  "-blob-s" and "-draw-spheres" arguments.)*
When a minima or maxima contains multiple voxels of identical brightness,
the position of one of the voxels among them is chosen arbitrarily.

You can use the
["**-out filename.rec**"](#Input-and-Output-files)
to create
an image showing which voxels belong to each minima or maxima.
(In that image, the voxel brightness will be an integer indicating
 the minima or maxima to which the voxel belongs, if any, starting at 1.
 When both minima and maxima are
 displayed, the minima are represented by negative integers.)

*Note:* By default, local minima and maxima which lie on the boundaries
of the image (or on the boundary of the mask region), are considered.
To ignore these extrema (ie, to consider only voxels which are surrounded
by other voxels) use the "**-ignore-boundary-extrema**" argument.


#### Non-max suppression: automatic disposal of minima or maxima

The "**-find-minima**" and "**-find-maxima**" arguments
are sometimes used together with the following arguments:
```
  -minima-threshold   threshold
```
or
```
  -maxima-threshold   threshold
```
This allows users to discard poor scoring minima (or maxima),
whose "scores" (brightnesses) do not fall below (or above) "threshold".

It may also be useful to discard minima which are too close together.
This can be done using a combination of these two arguments:
```
  -radii    radius
```
and
```
  -radial-separation  ratio
```
The "**-radii** argument allows you to assign a radius for all the minima
(or maxima).  When used together with "**-radial-separation**", it means that
if a pair of minima (or maxima) lie within the sum of their
radii times ratio (*2\*radius\*ratio*),
then the poorer scoring minima will be discarded.




# Segmentation

### -watershed type

If the "**-watershed**" argument is selected, the image will be segmented
using the
[classic watershed](https://imagej.net/plugins/classic-watershed#introduction)
algorithm.
This algorithm divides the image into different "valleys" or "basins".
The "*type*" argument must be either "*minima*" or "*maxima*".
If *type* = "*minima*", then each "basin" begins at local brightness *minima*
(ie. dark spots) within the image.  In that case, the surrounding voxels will
be brighter than the central voxel.
If *type* = "*maxima*",  then each "basin" begins at local brightness *maxima*
(ie. bright spots) within the image.
Each "basin" will be expanded outward until it reaches the boundary of another
basin (a.k.a. "ridge")
(Or until an optional brightness threshold is reached.
 Such thresholds can be set using the
["-watershed-threshold"](#-watershed-threshold-threshold)
argument.)
Afterwards, each voxel in the image will be assigned to an integer
indicating the local-minima basin to which it belongs.
By default voxels which lie at the "ridges"
(ie., at the boundary of multiple different drainage basins),
are assigned a value of 0.
(You can prevent this using the
["**-watershed-hide-boundaries**"](#-watershed-hide-boundaries)
argument.)

*Note:* These minima are sorted according to depth and begin at 1, not zero.
(Hence voxels in the first minima's basin, ie, the global minima basin, will be
 assigned to intensities of 1.  Voxels in the next deepest basin, 2, etc...)

*Note:* The locations of the corresponding local minima can be found by
invoking the program on the same image using the "**-find-minima**" argument.
(They are also sorted according to minima depth.)

*Note:* When searching neighboring voxels, all 26 neighbors (3x3x3-1)
are considered by default.
(You can use the
[**-neighbor-connectivity nc**](#-neighbor-connectivity-nc)
 argument to skip
 3D corner voxels by setting nc=2, and also 2D corners by setting nc=1.
 This may increase the number of spurious basins discovered.)

*Note:* Over-segmentation can be reduced by performing a Gaussian blur
on the image to remove small, insignificant local minima beforehand.
(This algorithm is usually only applied to images that have been smoothed
or filtered in advance to prevent oversegmentaion.)

*Note: If you save the resulting image in .MRC/.REC file format,
you can use either the "print_mrc_stats" program, or the "header"
program (distributed with IMOD) to find the brightest voxel in the image.
This number equals the number of basins in the image.*


### -watershed-threshold threshold

If the "**-watershed-threshold**" argument is also supplied, then
voxels whose brightness passes the *threshold* value, will be ignored.
In the output image, they will be assigned to a brightness equal to
the number of watershed basins in the image + 1.
*(This choice makes it easier to see the clusters when visualized with IMOD.
This can be overridden using the
[-undefined-out](#-undefined-out brightness) argument.)*


### -watershed-hide-boundaries

By default, voxels which lie on the border between two or more different basins
will be assigned a value of 0.
When this argument is selected, the basin to which a boundary voxel is assigned
will be chosen (arbitrarily) from among the neighboring basins.


### -watershed-boundary label

By default, voxels which lie on the border between two or more different basins
will be assigned a value of 0.
When this argument is included, these voxels will have intensities
which are assigned to *label* instead.  (This parameter is a number.)



### -neighbor-connectivity nc

*Note:* When searching neighboring voxels, all 26 neighbors (3x3x3-1)
surrounding the voxel are considered by default.
The "*nc*" parameter represents the maximum squared distance a voxel can
be from the center voxel in order for it to be considered a "neighbor".
(You can use the **-neighbor-connectivity nc** argument to skip
 3D corner voxels by setting nc=2, and also 2D corners by setting nc=1.
 This may increase the number of spurious local minima and maxima discovered.)



### -undefined-out brightness

This argument allows you to specify how "undefined" voxels appear in the
image that is generated by *filter_mrc*.  Voxels which are not defined
for some reason will usually end up with a brightness equal to *brightness*.
What is an "undefined" voxel?
Currently, if you are using either the [-watershed](#-watershed-type) or
[-connect](#-connect-threshold) arguments, then an "undefined" voxel
is a voxel whose brightness exceeds the threshold set in the 
[-watershed-threshold](#-watershed-threshold-threshold) or
[-connect](#-connect-threshold) argument.

*Note that masked voxels are not undefined.
If masks are used, the brightness of voxels which are
outside the mask is controlled using the
[-mask-out](#-mask-out brightness) argument, not this argument.*



### -connect threshold

The -connect argument is a voxel clustering tool
used to distinguish different bright objects in the same image.
This argument will cluster nearby (adjacent) bright voxels
*(or voxels with high "saliency")* into separate islands and then
generate a new image showing *which* island each voxel belongs to (if any).


This is a two-step process.
First, all the voxels whose brightness exceeds *threshold* are selected.
Then, this subset of voxels is partitioned into different "islands".
Islands are defined as sets of bright voxels which are all physically
adjacent to (touching) eachother, surrounded by oceans of dark voxels.
(The definition of "adjacency" can be controlled using the
[-neighbor-connectivity](#-neighbor-connectivity-nc)
argument.)

Once membership of each island has been decided,
a new image is generated showing which
voxels belong to each island.
(Note: This behavior is identical to the behavior of the
["*-watershed maxima*"](#-watershed-type)
argument when used together with the
["*-watershed-threshold*"](#-watershed-threshold-threshold)
argument.  However the "-connect" argument has additional options.)

*If the
["-connect"](#-connect-threshold)
argument is used together with the
["-membrane"](#Detecting-membranes),
["-edge"](#-edge-thickness), or
["-curve"](#Detecting-curves)
arguments,* then it means that additional, *more stringent* criteria
will be used to distinguish nearby curved objects from each other.
In that case, it is not the brightness of the voxel that matters, but its
*direction*, as well as its
"*saliency*" (a number indicating how closely the region near the voxel
resembles the feature you are trying to detect, like a curve, surface, or edge).
In order for two neighboring voxels to be in the same island, they must both
point in similar directions (see below),
and have high saliency above the *threshold* parameter specified by the user.
When detecting thin surfaces using
["**-membrane**"](#Detecting-membranes), the "*threshold*" parameter
determines how *membrane-like* a voxel must be in order for it to be included.
If the *threshold* parameter is chosen carefully, then these
different islands will hopefully correspond to completely different membrane
surfaces in the original image.
This *threshold* parameter will vary from image to image and
[must be chosen carefully](#determining-the--connect-threshold-parameter).
If the *threshold* parameter is too small,
then separate objects (eg. membranes) in the image will be joined together.
If too small, then individual objects (eg. membranes) in the image
will be split into multiple pieces.  (Fortunately, this can be
overridden using the [-must-link](#-must-link-FILE) argument.)

Because it often takes several iterations to choose the correct
thresholds, it is recommended that you run *filter_mrc* once in advance
to detect the membrane, saving your progress using the
["-save-progress"](#-save-progress-FILENAME)
argument.  *Then* when you are ready to connect the surfaces (or curves)
together using the "-connect" argument, use the 
["-load-progress"](#-load-progress-FILENAME)
argument to load the directional features of the image that you measured earlier
(to avoid having to recalculate them again).
(This was demonstrated in [example 1](#Example-1) and [example 3](#Example-3).)

*Note:* If you are unable to find thresholds which connect all of
the pieces together correctly, you can also use the
["**-must-link**"](#-must-link-FILE)
argument.
This will manually force different bright regions in the image
to belong to the same cluster (a.k.a. "island").

*Note:* Voxels whose brightness exceed the *threshold* value, will be assigned
to a brightness equal to the number of clusters + 1, by default.
(This choice makes it easier to see the clusters when visualized with IMOD.
This can be overridden using the
[-undefined-out](#-undefined-out brightness) argument.)


#### Clustering based on directional similarity

Some detection methods (including surface, edge, and curve detectors)
also report *directional* features in the image (such as the curve
direction or the surface normal direction at each location in the image).
*(Tensor attributes, such as the second derivative (Hessian),
are also reported.)*
The clustering algorithm used here is aware of any directional
*(as well as tensor)* attributes of the voxels (if applicable).

These directional attributes can be used to increase clustering sensitivity.
Directional information can be used distinguish different objects from
each other that are otherwise touching and might be grouped together.
For example, curves and surfaces are assumed to be moderately smooth.
You can prevent adjacent voxels with radically different
orientations from being grouped together (even if they both have high saliency).
This way, only voxels with similar orientations will be grouped into
connected surfaces.  (The degree of similarity can be set by the user
using the [*-connect-angle*](#-connect-angle-theta) argument.)
This strategy was used in [example 3](#Example-3).

#### Determining the -connect threshold parameter

Let's assume you are using the "-membrane" argument to detect thin
membrane-like surfaces in an image.
To choose the *threshold* parameter,
run membrane-detection
(for example using
["-membrane"](#Detecting-membranes)
and
["-tv"](#-tv-Ïƒ_ratio)
)
once in advance without the
["-connect"](#-connect-threshold)
argument
with the
["-save-progress"](#-save-progress-FILENAME)
argument
(as we did in the membrane-detection
[example](#Example-1)).
Open the file created during that step
(eg. "membranes.rec") in IMOD.
Find a place in this image where the saliency (brightness)
of the membrane you are interested in is weak.
Click on voxels located near the weakest point (a.k.a. "junction point",
or "saddle point") between two different bright blobs
corresponding to the *same* surface you are interested in.
These two islands will not be joined unless the *-connect* argument
is less than the weakest link connecting these two islands.
(and even then, they might not be joined
 if the voxel orientations are dissimilar.)
Select "Edit"->"Point"->"Value" menu option in IMOD to
see the "saliency" (brightness) of that voxel.
Do this several times in different places near the junction
write down the largest "saliency" number.
Then reduce this number by 20% (ie. multiply it by 0.8).
This makes a good first guess for the "*-connect*" parameter.

After using the "*-connect*" argument you can can
open the REC/MRC file we created
(eg "*membranes_clusters.rec*")
in IMOD, and click on different voxels (using "Edit"->"Point"->"Value")
to see whether the voxels were clustered correctly into the same object.
The voxel brightness values in that image should be integers
indicating which cluster they belong to
(reverse-sorted by cluster size, starting at 1).

If some clusters are too big, you can either increase the *threshold*
value, *or* you can alter increase angular sensitivity by reducing the
[*-connect-angle*](#-connect-angle-theta) from 45 degrees to 15 degrees
(or, equivalently by increasing the
*-cts*,*-ctn*,*-cvn*, and *-cvs* thresholds from 0.707 to 0.966).

Because it will probably take several tries to choose these parameters,
you can use the
["-load-progress"](#-load-progress-FILENAME)
argument to avoid having to recalculate the directional features
of the image that you (hopefully) measured earlier.
This was demonstrated in [example 3](#Example-3).

Also: It is a bad idea to try this on the original full-sized tomogram image.
1) Instead try this on one or more small cropped versions of the image
near the junction points of interest.
(You can crop images either by using IMOD,
 or by using the "crop_mrc" program distributed with *visfd*.)
2) Again, you can also reduce the size and resolution of the image
(during the detection process), using the ["-bin"](#-bin-binsize) argument.
For example, using "-bin 2" will often also produce reasonable results
and will reduce the computation time considerably.  Any features
detected at reduced resolution will be scaled up in size accordingly
(along with the voxel width).

Make sure clustering was successful *before* attempting to
close holes in the surface using programs like *meshlab* or *SSDRecon*.


### -must-link FILE

*WARNING: This is an experimental feature. Please report bugs.*

If the "**-connect**" argument fails, you can manually force
different regions in the image to the same object
by specifying a text file containing the locations of pairs of voxels
that you wish to link together.  You must prepare this text file in advance.

The coordinates of each voxel in the same connected group are listed
on separate lines in the file (which is in ASCII format).
Blank lines are used to separate voxels belonging to different objects.
There are two different file formats supported.

You can define links for many different objects in the image
in a single file by using blank-lines between different objects.
The following examples describe two *different* connected objects.
(For example, two different membranes.)

####  Example 1: *must-link* coordinates in units of voxels (from IMOD)

*If* the coordinates are enclosed in round-parenthesis ()
and separated by spaces, (as shown below)
*then* it is assumed that these coordinates are in units of voxels,
and should range from 1 to Nx, Ny, or Nz (which define the image size).

Considering the following text file:
```
(16 77 73)
(134 75 73)

(141 83 62)
(123 133 64) -1
```
*(Note: You* ***must include spaces*** between each coordinate,
even if commas are also present.)*

This example describes two *different* connected objects
(separated by a blank line).
For each of these objects, all of the voxels connected to the
first voxel (for example, near position 16, 77, 73)
will be joined with all of the voxels connected to the second voxel
(near position 134, 75, 73).
The voxels in the last two lines of the file
will be connected together as well.
*(The optional "-1" indicates that the user wants to ensure that these
last two surface fragments point in opposite directions.  This is explained
in more detail [here](#Manual-specification-of-fragment-orientation).)*


*(Note: When using this format, coordinates are assumed to begin at 1,
       and are rounded down to the next lowest integer.
       These coordinates do not have to lie exactly on the object you
       are trying to segment.  Nearby voxels should work adequately well.)*

**WARNING:** *Do not forget to put spaces between each integer (not commas).*

#### Suggestion: *Use IMOD (3dmod)*

The text above happens to be the text format printed by IMOD.
If you view a tomogram using "*3dmod -S*",
left-click anywhere on the image and press the "**F**" key,
the coordinates where you clicked will be printed to the
*3dmod* window in this format.
(The yellow "+" cursor, if visible, denotes this location.)
You can click on two places in the image that you want to link together.
Then copy the two lines printed by IMOD into your text file.
You can use this text file with the "**-must-link**" argument.

For convenience, you can copy the entire line of text printed by IMOD
into your text file.  (This includes the commas and the
extra text at the beginning and end of each line:
such as "Pixel" and "=...".  This text will be ignored.)

**WARNING:**
*Remember to put blank lines between voxels that you *don't* want to join
together. (And be warned that, depending on your thresholds,
they may get joined anyway.)*


####  Example 2: *must-link* coordinates in units of *physical distance*

If no parenthesis are used, then it is assumed
that the coordinates are in physical distance units (eg Angstroms).
```
379.68 1923.71 1822.46
3366.5 1873.09 1822.46

3543.68 2075.58 1544.03
3088.06 3341.18 1594.66
```
As with the previous example,
this example also describes two *different* connected objects.
For each of these objects, all of the voxels connected to the
first voxel (for example, at position 379.68,1923.71,1822.46)
will be joined with all of the voxels connected to the second voxel
(at position 3366.5,1873.09,1822.46).

*(Note: When using this format, voxel positions begin at 0, not 1.)*


### Manual specification of fragment orientation

#### Explanation of the problem

If you are segmenting a membrane surface (or a curve), an ambiguity arises.
Usually only a fraction of the surface or curve you are trying to
detect is visible.  The remaining portion of the surface must be
generated by some form of interpolation and/or reconstruction.
Reconstruction programs like *SSDRecon/PoissonRecon* will attempt to infer the
missing regions of the surface.  But *SSDRecon/PoissonRecon* needs to know
the outward direction of the surface at each *visible* point on the surface.
Fortunately, the *filter_mrc* program can detect the membrane surface,
as well as the direction of its surface normal at every voxel.
But, in the case of a closed surface, it cannot tell whether this direction
is pointing outward or inward.  *(In other words, there is an ambiguity
in the sign of the surface normal direction.)*
So for each surface fragment, *filter_mrc* will choose one of
these two surface directions arbitrarily.  Sometimes different
surface fragments will be assigned (automatically by *filter_mrc*)
to orientations which are not compatible with each other.
(The direction of one surface fragment points inward, the other one outward.)
This causes *SSDRecon/PoissonRecon* to fail
(usually in a catastrophic and visually obvious way).
But the fault lies with *filter_mrc*.

Hopefully most users will not encounter this error.
Fortunately if you do you can *manually* specify the orientation of
each successive fragment, as explained below.

#### Solution

To do this, they can provide a fourth number
(after the x,y,z coordinates), which is either 1 or -1.

- "1" means that the fragment is pointing in the same direction
(or a similar direction) compared to its predecessor.  
- "-1" means they point in opposite directions.
- If the number in the 4th column is 0, or if it is left unspecified,
the surface orientation will be determined automatically.

*(WARNING: This is an experimental feature.
  Please report bugs. -Andrew 2021-8-16.)*

### Example 3: Specifying the relative orientation of surface fragments

```
(106 177 89)
(149 181 93) 1
723.3 381.6 178.5 -1
(185 131 95)
```

The example above contains 4 surface fragments all linked together
and merged into the same surface.  The "1" on the second line means that the
second surface fragment points in a similar direction to its predecessor.
The "-1" on the third line means that the third surface fragment points in
the opposite direction of the second fragment.  *(As mentioned elsewhere,
parenthesis are optional and determine the units of the coordinates.)*
The orientation of the fourth surface fragment (at "(185 131 95)")
will be determined automatically (since the "1" or "-1" was omitted).



### -select-cluster cluster-ID
### -normals-file PLY_FILE

Once clustering is working, you can select one of the clusters using
the "**-select-cluster**" argument.
(Cluster-IDs are assigned in reverse order according to their size,
 beginning with the largest cluster, which has ID *1*.)
You can create a file which contains a list of voxels locations
(for the voxels belonging to that cluster),
as well as their surface orientations
using the "**-normals-file**".
The resulting file will be in .PLY format.
This oriented point-cloud file can be used for further processing
(for example for hole-repair using the "SSDRecon/PoissonRecon" program).

Note: Voxel coordinates in the point-cloud file are expressed
in physical units (ie Angstroms), not voxels,
Consequently they are not integers (unless the
["-w 1"](#Voxel-Width) argument was used).





### -max-distance-to-feature *distance*

*(This argument is optional.)*

The *distance* parameter specifies how far a voxel can be from the surface
(or curve) that you are detecting in order for it to be excluded from the
file containing the coordinates of that surface (or curve).
For example, suppose you are using the "-membrane" or "-edge" arguments
to detect a surface, in addition to the "-normals-file" argument
to save that surface to a PLY file.
If you also use "-max-distance-to-feature distance",
it means that voxels that are further than *distance* away from the detected
surface will *not* be included in the PLY file that is generated.

The *distance* parameter has units of physical distance, *not* voxels.
By default, it is equal to 1.3 times the width of each voxel.
Setting it to "inf" disables this feature.

*Note that voxels which are not excluded will have their coordinates
projected onto the surface (or curve), in an attempt to make it
as smooth as possible.*


### -max-voxels-to-feature *num_voxels*

*(This argument is optional.)*

This argument is identical to
[-max-distance-to-feature](#-max-distance-to-feature-num_voxels),
except that the distance is expressed in units of voxels
(not physical distance).


### -connect-angle theta

*(This argument is optional.)*

The *theta* argument determines how similar the
orientations of each voxel must be in order for a pair of neighboring voxels
to be merged into the same cluster (ie. the same membrane or same filament).
Neighboring voxels whose orientations differ by more than *theta* will
not be grouped into the same cluster (ie. the same surface or same curve).
If not specified, the default value is assumed to be 15 degrees.
However *theta* values from 10-60 degrees are common.

Note: The *-connect-angle* argument has no effect unless the
"-connect" argument is also supplied,
along with the "-membrane", "-edge", or "-curve" arguments.


#### -cts, -ctn, -cvs, -cvn

*(Warning: This is an advanced experimental feature.
These arguments can probably be ignored by most users.)*

Alternatively, if you need more detailed control over the criteria
used to decide whether to add voxels to an existing cluster,
then you can specify 4 different thresholds using the
"**-cts threshold**", "**-ctn threshold**",
"**-cvs threshold**", and "**-cvn *threshold**" arguments.
This is an *alternative* to (specifying the "**-connect-angle**" argument).


Motivation and explanation:
Ideally, if tensor-voting worked, then the results of tensor voting should
agree with the actual direction of the features located at each voxel location.
If not, then you can exclude these voxels from consideration.
To do that, the "*-cts*" and "*-cvs*" threshold arguments specify
the minimum similarity between the hessian of the image brightness with the
tensor and vector features that resulted from tensor voting, respectively.
Additionally, the tensors from *neighboring* voxels which are part of the
same surface or curve should be poinging in the same direction.
So the "*-ctn*" and "*-cvn*" threshold arguments specify is the
minimum similarity between the orientations of the tensors and vectors
from neighboring voxels, respectively.
All of these threshold parameters should be in the range from -1 to 1.
A *-cvn -threshold* value of 0.707 â‰ˆ cos(45Â°) and corresponds to a
45 degree difference between orientations of neighboring voxels.
In that case, neighboring voxels pointing in directions which
differ by more than 45Â° will be assigned to different clusters (membranes).
(This works reasonably well for phospholipid membranes.)

Note that the *-cts*, *-ctn*, *-cvs*, and *-cvn* arguments
have no effect unless the ["-membrane" and "-connect"](#Detecting-membranes)
arguments are also in use.





# Filters


### -gauss and -ggauss
The **-gauss** and **-gauss-aniso** arguments must be followed by one or more numbers specifying the width of the Gaussian filter to apply to your image:
```
   -gauss  Ïƒ
```
or
```
   -gauss-aniso  Ïƒ_x  Ïƒ_y  Ïƒ_z
```
In either case, the original image is convolved (ie. "blurred")
with a filter whose profile is *similar to* a Gaussian:
```
   h(x,y,z) = A*exp(-0.5 * ((x/Ïƒ_x)^2 + (y/Ïƒ_y)^2 + (z/Ïƒ_z)^2))
```
When *-gauss* is used, *Ïƒ_x = Ïƒ_y = Ïƒ_z = Ïƒ*.

#### *Details*
*The actual filter used is the product of three
[discrete Gaussian filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_space_implementation#The_discrete_Gaussian_kernel),
(one in the X, Y, and Z directions, with *t=Ïƒ^2*).
Discrete Gaussian filters are almost identical to ordinary Gaussian filters
(in the limit of large Ïƒ).  However a discrete Guassian filter may be more
suitable when used with small Ïƒ, to detect features that are only a couple
of voxels wide.*

#### Generalized gaussians

If **-ggauss** or **-ggauss-aniso** is used,
then the image is instead convolved with
[a generalized gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution#Version_1):
```
   h(x,y,z) = A*exp(-r^m)
    where r = âˆš((x/Ïƒ_x)^2 + (y/Ïƒ_y)^2 + (z/Ïƒ_z)^2))
```
The width of the Gaussian (ie, the Ïƒ_x, Ïƒ_y, Ïƒ_z arguments) should be specified in units of physical distance, not in voxels.
(The A coefficient will be determined automatically by normalization.)
By default **m** *= 2*,
however this can be overridden using the optional "**-exponent m**"
*Note:* that these *Ïƒ*, *Ïƒ_x*, *Ïƒ_y*, *Ïƒ_z*, parameters are a factor
of *âˆš2 times larger* than the corresponding *Ïƒ* ("sigma") parameter
traditionally used in the
[Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).
(For your convenience, you can plot these functions for various parameters using
the "draw_filter1D.py -ggauss A s m" python script which is located in the same directory.
In this case, the "s" parameter is specified in voxels, not physical distance.)
*Note:* The calculation is
[fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_filter)
if you use the default exponent of 2.
*Changing the exponent will slow down the filter considerably.*

The filter is truncated far away from the central peak at a point which is chosen automatically according the Ïƒ, Ïƒ_x, Ïƒ_y, Ïƒ_z parameters selected by the user.  However this can be customized using the
["-truncate-threshold"](#Filter-Size)
and
["-truncate"](#Filter-Size)
arguments if necessary (see below).

Note: By default, the image blurring that results from applying a
Gaussian filter is adjusted near the image boundary (or *mask* boundary)
so that the average brightness there is not effected.
This can be disabled using the
[-normalize-filters no](#-normalize-filters-yes/no) argument.

### -median radius

*(WARNING: This untested feature requires a modern C++17 compliant compiler,
and is not enabled by default.)*

This argument will apply a
[median filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter)
filter to your image.
At each location in the image, the median brightness of the
voxels that lie within a distance of *radius* from that location
will be calculated.
*Warning:* This is a very slow operation for large *radius* parameters.


## Thresholding, Clipping and Rescaling (Intensity Map Filters):

Thresholding filters provide a way to rescale (map) the
intensity of all of the voxels in the image to new intensities.
For example, you could multiply these intensities by a constant,
and/or clip them within a specified range.
Thresholding operations can be used to insure that the intensities
(ie. brightnesses) for every voxel in the image lie between 0 and 1.
They can also be used to select only voxels whose intensities lie within
a narrow range of interest.

*Note:* All threshold operations are performed *after* normal filtering operations have been applied (such as -gauss, -dog, -dogg, -fluct, or -log filters).



### -rescale m b

Rescale the voxel intensities (multiply the brightnesses by *m*)
and add an offset (*b*).
Afterwards *new_intensity=m\*old_intensity+b*.

```
         output
        intensity
           /|\        /
            |        /
            |       /     /|
            |      /   m / |
            |     /     /__|
            |    /                      
  <---------|---/------------------->  input
         |  |  /                       intensity
     -b  |  | /
        \|/ |/
            /
           /|
          / |
         /  |/
```



### -rescale-min-max outA outB

If you use the **-rescale-min-max** argument, then
image voxel intensities in the final image
(after all other processing has been applied)
will be shifted and rescaled so that the
minimum and maximum voxel intensities will be *outA* and *outB*.

*(Note: You can use the "histogram_mrc.py" script to
see if your intensity values in the image lie in the range you expect.
You can find the brightness of a particular voxel in IMOD (3dmod)
by left-clicking on that voxel (to move the yellow-cursor), and then by
selecting the "Edit"->"Point"->"Value" menu option (or pressing the "F" key).
However, for 8-bit MRC files, IMOD/3dmod will report the brightness values
as unsigned integers between 0-255, shifting the brightness values upwards
to avoid negative values.  So if you have an 8-bit MRC or REC
file, you should use IMOD's "newstack" program to convert the image into 32-bit
floats using "newstack -input mask_file.rec -output new_file.rec -mode 2".
Then use 3dmod to view the 32-bit version of the image, the brightness values
should be reported correctly.)



### -invert

This filter replaces bright voxels with dark ones, and visa versa,
while keeping the average voxel brightness the same.
(To calculate the new voxel intensity,
 the *difference* between the original voxel intensity
 and the average intensity is *subtracted* from the average intensity.)
Inverting an image can be useful to prepare files which you plan
to read with other programs (such as ChimeraX and IMOD).




### -clip a b

The "**--clip a b**" argument will
restrict the range of voxel intensities to a range of your choosing.
This can be useful to eliminate extremely dark or bright voxels from
your image.
(Such spurious voxels can make it difficult to
 detect faint objects in the original image.)

```
-clip 0.48 0.52
```
The resulting voxels intensities will lie in the range from 0.48 to 0.52.
```
 output
 intensity
    /|\                              _________________
0.52 |                           _.-'                 
     |                       _,-'                 
     |                   _,-'            
0.48 |________________,-'                     ________\ input
                      ^              ^                / intensity
                     0.48          0.52
                  (thresh_a)    (thresh_b)
```

*Note:
If instead, you want the output intensities to range from*
**0 to 1**,
(for example), then use the more general*
"**-thresh2**"
*argument. (See below.)*

*Note:
Unfortunately, intensity values can be difficult to guess.
When choosing thresholds, the
[histogram_mrc.py program](doc_histogram_mrc.md)
can be useful.
It displays the range of voxel intensities in an image.
Alternatively you can use the "**-cl a b**" argument.*


### -cl
```
-cl  a  b
```
The "**-cl**" argument is similar to the "**-clip**" argument, however it
allows you to specify the minimimum and maximum intensity parameters
in units of Ïƒ, where Ïƒ is the standard deviation of the brightness values
present in the image.  (Excluding masked voxels.  See below.)  Typical usage:
```
-cl  -2.5 2.5
```
This will clip voxel intensities which are either 2.5 standard-deviations
below or above the average intensity value, respectively

**Note:**
You can use the ["**-mask**"](#-mask-MRC_FILE) argument to exclude
certain voxels from the clipping and thresholding operations.
When using "**-mask**" together with "**-cl**", then
these voxels will also be excluded from consideration when
calculating the average and spread(Ïƒ) of voxel intensities.


### -thresh threshold

If the "-thresh" argument is passed, it must be followed by a number
("thresh01").
Voxels with intensities *below* this number will be replaced 0,
and voxels *above* this number will be replaced with 1 (by default, see below).
For example:
```
-thresh 0.5
```
results in:
```
          output
         intensity
            /|\
             |
   outB   -->|                       __________________________\
(usually 1)  |                      |                          /
             |                      |                 
             |                      |            
   outA   -->|______________________|  ________________________\ input
(usually 0)                         ^                          / intensity
                                   0.5
                               (threshold)

```

*Note: When choosing thresholds, the
       [histogram_mrc.py program](doc_histogram_mrc.md)
       can be useful.
       It displays the range of voxel intensities in an image.*


*Note: You can use the "-thresh-range outA outB" argument to scale the
       resulting voxel intensities from outA to outB (instead of from 0 to 1).*




### -thresh-interval in_a in_b
Select a range of voxels whose intensities fall
within the range from *in_a* to *in_b*.
Each voxel's new intensity will be a function of its former intensity.
If the in_a < in_b, then the thresholding function will be:

```
         output
        intensity
           /|\
            |
            |
   outB  -->|              ___________________
(usually 1) |             |                   |
            |             |                   |
   outA  -->|_____________|                   |________________\ input
(usually 0)              in_a                in_b              / intensity
```

*Note: You can use the "-thresh-range outA outB" argument to scale the
       resulting voxel intensities from outA to outB (instead of from 0 to 1).
       (It is not necessary for outA < outB.)*

*Note: This command is equivalent to "-thresh4 in_a in_a in_b in_b"*



### -thresh2 thresh_a thresh_b

If the "-thresh2" argument is passed, then it must be followed by 2 numbers.
For example:
```
-thresh2 0.48 0.52
```
In this case, the resulting voxel intensities in the range
from *thresh_a* to *thresh_b* will be scaled between 0 and 1
and clipped above and below.
Graphically, the threshold filter resembles a step function
with a smooth ramp between *thresh_a* and *thresh_b*:

```
           output
         intensity
            /|\
             |
   outB   -->|                               _________________
(usually 1)  |                           _.-'                 
             |                       _,-'                 
             |                   _,-'            
   outB   -->|________________,-'                     ________\ input
(usually 0)                   ^              ^                / intensity
                             0.48          0.52
                          (thresh_a)    (thresh_b)
```

*Note: When choosing thresholds, the
       [histogram_mrc.py program](doc_histogram_mrc.md)
       can be useful.
       It displays the range of voxel intensities in an image.*

*Note: You can use the "-thresh-range outA outB" argument to scale the
       resulting voxel intensities from outA to outB (instead of from 0 to 1).*


### -thresh4 thresh01_a thresh01_b thresh10_a thresh10_b

Sometimes it is useful to select a ***narrow range of voxel intensities***.
*filter_mrc* allows you to do this using the **"-thresh4"** argument.
The **"-thresh4"** must be followed by 4 numbers in order, for example:
```
 -thresh4 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6
```
The resulting image voxels will be scaled
between 0 and 1 according to the following function:

```
         output
        intensity
           /|\
            |
   outB  -->|                 ________________                
(usually 1) |             _,-'                `-._
            |         _,-'                        `-._
   outA  -->|______,-'                                `-._______\ input
(usually 0)        ^         ^                ^         ^       / intensity
                  0.3       0.4              0.5       0.6
             thresh_01_a  thresh_01_b    thresh_10_a  thresh_10_b
```

*Note: When choosing thresholds, the
       [histogram_mrc.py program](doc_histogram_mrc.md)
       can be useful.
       It displays the range of voxel intensities in an image.*


*Note: You can use the "-thresh-range outA outB" argument to scale the
       resulting voxel intensities from outA to outB (instead of from 0 to 1).*




### -thresh-gauss x0 Ïƒ
Select a range of voxels whose intensities fall within a Gaussian
centered around *x0* with standard deviation Ïƒ.

```
         output
        intensity
           /|\
            |
    outB    |                       _---_
(usually 1) |                     ,'  :  `.
            |                    /    :<-->\
            |                _.-'     :  Ïƒ  `-,_
    outA -->'------------''''         :         ````------------> input
(usually 0)                          x0                          intensity
```

*Note: You can use the "-thresh-range outA outB" argument to scale the
       resulting voxel intensities from outA to outB (instead of from 0 to 1).*


### -dog
When the "**-dog**" or "**-dog-aniso**" filter is selected, a
[Difference-of-Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians)
filter will be used.
The **-dog** and **-dog-aniso** arguments must be followed by numbers indicating the width of the Gaussians you wish to convolve with your image.
(Equivalently, the numbers indicate the band of frequencies you wish to keep from your original image.)
```
  -dog  a  b
```
or:
```
  -dog-aniso  a_x  a_y  a_z  b_x  b_y  b_z
```
In either case,
The original image will be convolved with the following function:
```
  h(x,y,z) =   A*exp(-0.5 * ((x/a_x)^2 + (y/a_y)^2 + (z/a_z)^2))
             - B*exp(-0.5 * ((x/b_x)^2 + (y/b_y)^2 + (z/b_z)^2))
```
When *-dog* is used,
*a_x = a_y = a_z = a*
and
*b_x = b_y = b_z = b*

The "-dog" argument can be used to remove low frequencies from an image.  *(This
is useful for removing slowly changing brightness gradients in the background.)*
To do that use the [-dog a b](#-dog) argument, setting *a=0*, and setting *b* to
a large number (such as the width of the image).

*(Note: Unless the "-w 1" argument is used, the a and b parameters
should both be expressed in units of physical distance, not voxels.)*


### LoG filters
### -log, -log-r, -log-d, and -log-aniso


When the "**-log**", "**-log-r**", and "**-log-d**", or "**-log-aniso**"
arguments are selected, a
[Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian (LoG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection)
filter is applied on the source image.
(See implementation details below.)
The Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian filter applies a Gaussian blur to the image
(whose width is specified by the user),
and then calculates the Laplacian of the result.
Features in the image of various sizes can be emphasized
using this kind of filter, and the result can be saved as a new image using
["**-out** filename.rec"](#Input-and-Output-files).
The "**-log**", "**-log-aniso**", "**-log-r**", and "**-log-d**"
arguments described here are typically only chosen when the user already
knows the approximate size of the features they want to emphasize
in the image.
```
    -log  Ïƒ
```
When "**-log  Ïƒ**" is used, a LoG filter will be applied
to the image using a Gaussian width (Ïƒ).
Alternatively, if the user wishes to specify the actual size
(the radius or diameter) of the objects they want to emphasize,
then they can (equivalently) use
```
    -log-r radius
```
or
```
    -log-d diameter
```
instead.
There is also an anisotropic version of this filter as well:
```
    -log-aniso  Ïƒ_x  Ïƒ_y  Ïƒ_z**
```
The new image which is generated will *tend* to have have bright and dark spots
wherever bright and dark objects of the corresponding size can be found.
This image can be searched for (local) minima and maxima
by running this program again on the new image using the
"**-find-minima**", "**-find-maxima**" and "-radial-separation" arguments.
These locations can be saved to a file and then a new anotated image can be
created using the
["**-draw-spheres**"](#-draw-spheres-filename)
argument.  This provides a fast, sloppy,
and unselective way to search for features in an image.
However scale-free
[**blob detection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection)
is a more robust (and computationally expensive) way to detect objects
of a given size within an image.

*(Implementation note: The LoG filter described here is approximated internally
 using a DoG filter. You can control the accuracy of this approximation using
 the
 ["-dog-delta Î´"](#Implementation-of-LoG-filters-and-blob-detectors)
 argument.)



### -fluct and -fluct-aniso
Usage:
```
  -fluct  r
```
The "**-fluct**" filter calculates the magnitude of
the voxel intensity fluctuations relative to their local surroundings.
This is useful for finding regions in an image with nearly uniform brightness
and regions whose brightness fluctuates wildly.
*r* is the effective search radius.

To compute this, near every voxel, a Gaussian-weighted average
intensity is computed with the same effective radius, *r*.
A Gaussian-weighted squared-difference between all the nearby voxel intensities
and this local average intensity is also computed.
A new image is generated whose voxel intensities equal this
local average squared difference intensity of nearby voxels.

The "**-fluct-aniso**" variant allows the user to control the width
of the Gaussian independently in the x,y,z directions:
```
  -fluct-aniso   r_x  r_y  r_z
```
#### Implementation detail:
 The width of the Gaussian, Ïƒ, is chosen so that the effective
 number of voxels under the 3D Gaussian,
 (which can be interpreted as the 3D integral of the unnormalized 3D Gaussian,
 (2\*Ï€\*Ïƒ^2)^(3/2))
 equals the volume of a sphere of radius r
 (4/3)\*Ï€\*r^3.
 This yields Ïƒ=(9Ï€/2)^(-1/6)r.

 It might seem more straightforward to simply consider the fluctuations in
 brightnesses of all of the voxels which lie within a fixed radius from
 each target voxel.  However using Gaussian weighted averages instead
 accomplishes essentially the same goal and is much more
 [computationally efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_filter).

 If you prefer, instead of using a Gaussian, you can instead perform the
 fluctuation calculation over a hard spherical region by using the
 "-exponent n" argument.
 (This parameter is 2 by default.  Changing it will slow down the calculation.)
 As n is increased, the region over which the fluctuations in brightness
 are calculated becomes more and more like a uniform sphere with radius Ïƒ.
 (So if you do this, be sure to multiply your radius argument, r,
  by (9Ï€/2)^(1/6)â‰ˆ1.5549880806696572 to compensate.)





## Resizing the image

### -bin binsize

Reduce the resolution of the image in each direction by a factor of *binsize*.
(*binsize* must be a positive integer.)
The new image will be smaller in each direction by a factof of *binsize*.

Motivation: Reducing the resolution of an image can often dramatically
reduce the computation time necessary to detect objects in the image.
If you are detecting features in the image (such as membranes or blobs)
that are significantly larger (or thicker) than the voxel width,
then a reduction in resolution by a factor of 2 or so
should not effect your ability to detect it accurately,
(and could make tensor voting up to 64 times faster (as of 2021-7-12)).

Note that you can use this argument together with other arguments.
If you do that, the reduction of resolution occurs before all
other operations are performed (such as "-blob" or "-membrane" detection).
This allows you to reduce the image size before
these other expensive calculations are performed.

Note that the width of each voxel will be increased accordingly,
so that the positions of any features in the image that you detect
should not be significantly effected by the change in resolution.
(This includes the coordinates of the surface mesh.)
Similarly, when using "-bin", the user does not need to alter
any of the other parameters or arguments passed to the program
(such as the thickness parameters or sigma parameters
that characterize the size of the objects they want to detect).
The software will automatically adjust these parameters
to compensate for the change in image resolution.




# Annotation of detected objects in an image

### (-draw-spheres filename)
### (-draw-hollow-spheres filename)


The "**-draw-spheres**" argument does not perform a filtering operation
on the original image.
Instead it reads a text file (eg "filename") containing between 3 and 5 columns
indicating the location, size, and brightness of a series of points in space.
After reading that file, a new image will be created
(the same size as the input image)
with each blob represented (by default) by a solid sphere centered
at the points of interest superimposed on the original image (by default).
The "**-draw-hollow-spheres**" argument behaves similarly,
however it draws hollow spherical shells instead of solid spheres,
and it superimposes them upon the original image.


#### -draw-spheres file format

```
# Column meaning:
#  X    Y    Z    diameter brightess

56.45 55.74 32.01 15.62483 2.658
87.88 75.21 42.53 63.91314 7.172
66.11 59.92 32.38 13.05745 7.172
:
```

Each line in the file contains information describing a different sphere.
The first three numbers on each line are assumed to store the x,y, and z
coordinates of the center of that sphere.
*(Unless the ["-w 1"](#Voxel-Width) argument is used, the coordinates and
diameters are assumed to be in physical units (eg. Angstroms), not voxels.)*
If the file contains a 4th column, then it is assumed to
store the diameter of each sphere.
(Otherwise the "spheres" will be only 1 voxel wide by default.)
Alternatively, the size of *all* of the spheres can be specified using
the the "**-diameters d**" or "**-radii r**" arguments.
If the file contains a 5th column, it is assumed to represent the brightness
of that sphere.  (Otherwise, the sphere brightness is 1 by default, unless
it is overridden using the "**-foreground brightness**" argument.)

*Incidentally, the format of this file matches the format of the text file
generated during blob detection (using the "-blob" argument).
If used this way, then blobs with good scores typically appear as black
or white spheres, and grey spheres correspond to blobs with poor scores.
(If you are using IMOD, the score of a given blob can be queried by
clicking on one of the voxels somewhere on the sphere or spherical shell marker
for that blob and selecting the "Edit"->"Point"->"Value" menu option,
or by pressing the "F" key.  The brightness of voxel at that location
will be printed to the IMOD control window. That brightness is the score
of the corresponding blob.)*

#### Background voxels

Again, by default, the background voxels will be the same as the voxels
in the in the original image.  (This can be overridden.  See below.)
However, depending on the brightness of the spheres,
this often results in an image where the background
voxels are either much brighter or much darker than the spheres
(and thus appearing all white or all black when displayed on the screen).
Instead their brightness can be shifted and rescaled
so that the background image remains easy to see in the presence
of the spheres.  This can be done by using the "**-background-scale ratio**"
(and optional "**-background brightness**") arguments.
The background voxel brightnesses will be multiplied by the **ratio** parameter
and added to the the **brightness** parameter (if specified).
(These parameters are 1 and 0 by default, respectively.)
If you want all of the background voxels to have the *same*
brightness use the "**-background brightness**" and
"**-background-scale 0**" arguments.

Choosing the correct *ratio* and *brightness* offsets can be difficult.
If you use the "**-background-auto**" argument, then the brightness of
background voxels will be automatically shifted and rescaled in an attempt to
make them optimally visible when superimposed against the foreground voxels.
The user can influence how this is done by (optionally) specifying the
"**-background-scale ratio**" and "**-background brightness**" arguments.
When "**-background-auto**" is in use, the *ratio* parameter is
interpreted differently.  In this case, the *ratio* parameter
controls the *contrast* of the background image
*relative to the average brightness of the spheres*.
This *ratio* parameter is typically between 0 and 1.

Regardless of whether "**-background-auto**" is used,
whenever the *ratio* parameter is larger, it is easier
to see the background image and harder to see the spheres.
When it is 0, the original image is not visible and
all of the background voxels are set to the **-background brightness**
parameter value (which is also 0 by default).

#### Examples:

- **Example 1:**
Use "**-draw-spheres filename**" to read a file containing a list of spheres
and draw then directly on top of the original image (without adjusting the
brightness of the voxels from that image).

- **Example 2:** In order to set the brightness of the sphere voxels to 
1.5, and the background voxel brightnesses to 0.5, add these arguments:
"**-foreground 1.5**", "**-background 0.5**", and "**-background-scale 0**".
(The "**-foreground 1.5**" argument is not necessary if the file contains
a fifth column.)

- **Example 3:** To *automatically* adjust the contrast and brightness
of the background voxels to make them visible in the presence of the spheres,
use the "**-background-auto**" argument.  If the results are still not visually
appealing, try using the "**-background-scale ratio**" argument, and vary
the *ratio* parameter between 0 and 1 until the image looks reasonable.
(Typical values of the *ratio* parameter are between 0.1 and 0.3.)


#### Thin hollow spheres

If "**-draw-hollow-spheres**" is used, then hollow spheres are drawn instead.
The thickness of each hollow spherical shell can be controlled using the
"**-sphere-shell-thickness thickness**" or
"**-sphere-shell-ratio ratio**" arguments. 
In the first example, the *thickness* of the sphere is the same for all spheres,
regardless of sphere size.  In that case, the *thickness* argument should
be specified in physical distance units
(*or* in voxels, if you are using the ["-w 1"](#Voxel-Width) argument).
On the other hand, if you use the "**-spheres-shell-ratio ratio**" argument,
the thickness is expressed as a ratio, relative to the radius of the sphere. 
(Larger spheres will have thicker shells.) 
Setting the "ratio" to 1 results in a solid rather than hollow sphere. 
Setting it to 0.1 results in a spherical shell thickess
equal to 1/10th the radius of the sphere. 
(To insure that the spherical shell always remains visible,
 the minimum shell thickness will never be less than 1 voxel wide, by default. 
 However you can customize the minimum thickness
 using the "**-sphere-shell-thickness-min thickness**" argument.  In this case,
 the *thickness* argument should be in voxels, not in physical distance units.)




## -discard-blobs

```
   -discard-blobs  orig_blobs.txt  selected_blobs.txt
```

When *filter_mrc* is run using the "**-discard-blobs**" argument,
no image processing is done on the source image.
Instead, *filter_mrc* will read the list of blobs reported in a file
(created by running *filter_mrc* with the *-blob* argument),
and discard blobs with poor scores, or blobs which overlap with other blobs.
The new list of blobs can then be visualized later by running
*filter_mrc* again using the "**-draw-spheres**" argument.

Note that the "**-discard-blobs**" argument by itself has no effect.
You must run the program with other arguments telling it
which blobs you want to discard.
Typically you would run *filter_mrc* together with the "**-discard-blobs**",
**-maxima-threshold**, (or **-minima-threshold**, or
**-auto-thresh score**)
AND the
**-radial-separation** (or **-max-volume-overlap**)
(and possibly the **-mask** arguments)
***...simultaneously***.
(See below for details.)


#### Automatic disposal of overlapping blobs

There are several arguments you can use to discard overlapping blobs
which are typically invoked together with
["**-discard-blobs**"](#-discard-blobs)
```
   -max-volume-overlap  fraction
   -max-volume-overlap-small  fraction
   -radial-separation  fraction
```

*(Note: To use these arguments, the image must be associated 
 with a list of blobs that was detected by previously running 
 this program with the "-blob" argument on that image.
 You must specify that list of blobs using the "-discard-blobs" 
 argument, which must also appear in the argument list.)*

Whenever two blobs overlap, the one with the better score
(ie. higher score for maxima, and lower score for minima)
is superimposed upon the one with a poorer score.
If they overlap too much, the user can request that the
one with a poorer score is discarded.
Again, this does not happen by default.

##### -max-volume-overlap fraction
##### -max-volume-overlap-small fraction
Disposal of overlapping blobs can be accomplished using the
"**-max-volume-overlap fraction**" argument.
If this argument is specified, then the poorer scoring blob is discarded only
when the volume overlapping region between the two spheres exceeds *fraction*
multiplied by the volume of the *larger* sphere.
(A larger *fraction* means that more overlap is permitted.  
Setting it to 1.0 disables overlap prevention.)
Additionally, you can specify the maximum amount of overlap with the *smaller*
of the two spheres using the "**-max-volume-overlap-small fraction**" argument.
(See example below.)

##### -radial-separation fraction
Alternatively, you can use the
"**-radial-separation fraction**" argument
to discard blobs if the distance is less than **fraction**
multiplied by the sum of their radii.
The "**fraction**" parameter is a number between 0 and 1.
(A larger number means less overlap is permitted.
 Setting *fraction=0.0* allows complete overlap and disables this argument.)
*Note:* You can *either* discard blobs based on
[*overlapping volume*](#-max-volume-overlap-fraction)
or
[*overlapping radii*](#-radial-separation-fraction)
but not both.


##### Example: Hierarchical blob detection

Sometimes a small spherical blob may reside *within* a significantly larger
sphere. If the small sphere's volume is less than half of the larger sphere
(for example), you may want to keep both spheres.
To prevent the small sphere from being discarded, you can use
[**-max-volume-overlap 0.5**](#-max-volume-overlap-fraction)
together with
[**-max-volume-overlap-small 1**](#-max-volume-overlap-small-fraction).


#### Automatic disposal of poor scoring blobs

Typically poor-scoring blobs are discarded using either of these arguments:
```
   -minima-threshold  thresh_min
```
or
```
   -maxima-threshold  thresh_max
```

*(Note: To use either of these arguments, the image must be 
 associated with a list of blobs that was detected by previously 
 running this program with the "-blob" argument on that image.
 You must specify that list of blobs using the "-discard-blobs" 
 argument, which must also appear in the argument list.)*

Here, "thresh_min" and "thresh_max" are the thresholds below which,
and above which, the blob score must lie in order not to be discarded,
respectively.
Since the general magnitude of the blobs' scores
are not known in advance,
sometimes the following arguments are useful instead:
```
   -minima-ratio  ratio_min
   -maxima-ratio  ratio_max
```
The *-maxima-ratio* argument allows you to discard maxima whose score
is less than *ratio_max* times the blob with the highest score,
(where *ratio_max* is a number between 0 and 1.
 *-minima-ratio* behaves in a similar way.)
*(Note: You can either use thresolds or ratios, but you cannot mix both.)*
*(Note: This only makes sense in the context of discarding blobs.
        These arguments have no effect unless you are also using the
        "-discard-blobs" argument.)*





### -auto-thresh score -supervised file_accept.txt file_reject.txt

As an alternative to specifying the threshold(s) manually,
(using the "-minima-threshold" or "-maxima-threshold" arguments),
you can instead supply examples of blobs that you want to keep,
and blobs you want to discard 
(using the "-auto-thresh" and "-supervised" arguments).

*(Note: To use these arguments, the image must be associated 
 with a list of blobs that was detected by previously running 
 this program with the "-blob" argument on that image.
 You must specify that list of blobs using the "-discard-blobs" 
 argument, which must also appear in the argument list,
 along with "-auto-thresh" and "-supervised".)*


Blobs will be discarded if their "score" is not sufficiently high.
(Equivalently, they will be discarded if they are not sufficiently
 bright or dark compared to their surroundings.)
These blob locations are listed
on separate lines in the "file_accept.txt" and "file_reject.txt" arguments.
The file format for both of these files is described
[here.](#-must-link-FILE)
*(Note: As explained in that link, you can obtain the contents of this file
        by clicking on objects of interest in IMOD.)*
This range of allowed scores is determined automatically from these examples.
The (upper-bound or lower-bound) threshold will be chosen
which minimize the number of incorrectly classified blobs.
Here is an example of the output:
```
  threshold lower bound: 37.921
  threshold upper bound: inf
```
Equal weight is given to false-positives and false-negatives,
(so choose your examples accordingly).
Choosing blobs which are "edge-cases" is recommended.
(IE. blobs that would difficult to classify or are barely visible.)


*(Note: These arguments must be supplied together as shown.
        The "-auto-thresh" argument will have no effect unless
        you are also using the "-supervised" and the
        "-discard-blobs" arguments as well.
        The "score" argument is not a number, but literally the word "score".
        Eventually, it will be possible to supply a list of other criteria used
        for classifying blobs, but as of 2019-5-07, only "score" is available.)*

*(Note: You must provide examples of both
        blobs that you want to keep and
        blobs that you want to discard.
        These example blobs must already be present
        within the list of blobs that you have provided
        to the "-discard-blobs" argument.
        If you are using a mask, then blobs whose centers lie outside
        the mask will be ignored.)*


### -auto-thresh score -supervised-multi list_of_files.txt

*(WARNING: This is an experimental feature as of 2019-6-19.
           It has not been tested carefully, and may be difficult to use.)*

The "*-supervised-multi*" argument is a variant of "*-supervised*"
which allows you to use multiple training sets 
associated with multiple different images.

*(Note: Each of those images must be associated with a list of blobs 
  that were detected by previously running this program
  with the "-blob" argument on that image.)*

The program will consider the blobs at these locations, 
and calculate a range of scores which encloses
the positive training data with as few errors as possible.
The result is printed to the standard-error.
Here is an example of the output:
```
  threshold lower bound: -inf
  threshold upper bound: -131.016
```

*(Note: Unlike the "-supervised" argument, 
        you cannot use the "-supervised-multi" argument simultaneously
        with the "-discard-blobs" or "-mask" arguments.
        Discarding overlapping or masked blobs must be done in advance.
        See below.)*

#### File format details:

The file supplied to this argument (eg, "list_of_files.txt"),
should be a 3-column text file containing file names.
Each line of this file contains the names of 3 other files containing 
information about a particular image.

Suppose you have collected training data from 5 different images.
Example ("list_of_files.txt"):

```
training_pos_1.txt  training_crds_neg_1.txt  blob_info_1.txt
training_pos_2.txt  training_crds_neg_2.txt  blob_info_2.txt
training_pos_3.txt  training_crds_neg_3.txt  blob_info_3.txt
training_pos_4.txt  training_crds_neg_4.txt  blob_info_4.txt
training_pos_5.txt  training_crds_neg_5.txt  blob_info_5.txt
```
The first two files, *("training_pos_1.txt", "training_crds_neg_1.txt")*,
contain positive and negative training data corresponding to objects of
interest from that image (image#1).
(The format of these files is explained earlier in the documentation 
for the "-supervised" argument.)
The third file listed on that line contains a list of blobs that were 
detected in the image.)
(Those files are generated by running this program on that image
 separately using the ["**-blob**"](#Blob-detection) argument.
 See the docmentation for the ["**-blob**"](#Blob-detection) argument
 for details.)

*NOTE: This list of blobs (eg, contained in "blob_info_1.txt")
must not contain overlapping blobs, or blobs that lie
outside the mask.*
So before you use the "-supervised-multi" argument,
you should delete the overlapping blobs in each of these lists
by running this program again separately on the 
blobs you detected earlier
(by using the
["-discard-blobs"](#-discard-blobs),
["-radial-separation"](#Automatic-disposal-of-overlapping-blobs),
or
["-max-volume-overlap"](#Automatic-disposal-of-overlapping-blobs),
and/or
["-max-volume-overlap-small"](#Automatic-disposal-of-overlapping-blobs)
and
["-mask"](#-mask-MRC_FILE)
arguments).
***All*** of this must be done separately for each of the N images you want to 
simultaneously analyze (5 in this example), ***before*** you attempt to use
this program with the "-supervised-multi" argument.


### -blob-intensity-vs-radius center_type blobs_file.txt base_name

The "**-blob-intensity-vs-radius**" argument creates a list of txt
files (one per blob) storing the brightness as a function of
distance from the center of the blob.
The distance is expressed in *physical* units
(such as Angstroms, **not voxels**).
The *first* argument **center_type** must be one of these choices:
***center***, ***max***, ***min***.
This indicates whether we should measure distance to the *center*
of the blob, or the location of its intensity *maxima* or *minima*,
respectively.
The *second argument* is the file containing a list of blob
locations and radii.
It should be in the same format as the file created by the
"**-blob**" argument  (See documentation above.)
The *third argument* is the name we will attach to the beginning
of each file that we create.  The program will create a series
of files with names lie "base_name_1.txt", "base_name_2.txt", ...
"base_name_N.txt", where *N* is the number of blobs in the
"blobs_file.txt" file.



#### Specifying the radius or Gaussian-sigma parameters for the objects of interest

The
"**-blob-r**",
"**-blob-s**"
(and
"**-log-r**",
"**-log**")
arguments
are variants of the
["**-blob**"](#Blob-detection)
(and
["**-log-d**"](#LoG-filters)) argument.
Their parameters are either specified by the approximate radius(râ‰ˆÏƒâˆš3),
or the Gaussian width (Ïƒ) of the objects
that you wish to detect within the image (instead of the object's diameter).


####  Visualizing blobs using the "*-draw-spheres*" argument

Again, after
[blob-detection](#Blob-detection)
AND
[non-max suppression](#Non-max-suppression:-automatic-disposal-of-blobs),
you can visualize the resulting blobs using the
["**-draw-spheres**"](#-draw-spheres-filename)
and
["**-out**"](#Input-and-Output-files)
arguments.





# Masking

The optional "-mask", "-mask-select", and "-mask-out" arguments allow you to
ignore certain voxels from the source image (tomogram).

Using "masks" allows the user to perform the filtering considering only a
subset of voxels in the tomogram (ie, the "mask").

Masks can also be used to give some voxels more consideration
than others during the bluring (filtering) process.  (A.K.A. "weighting".)
This makes it possible to apply a filter to an image
whose boundaries are smooth and gradual
(slowly fading from 1 to 0 near a curve-shaped boundary, for example),
as opposed to jagged and rectangular.



### -mask MRC_FILE

The argument following the
"-mask" argument should be the name of a 3D image file
(in MRC/REC format) of the same size as the input image.
During the filtering process, only voxels belonging to the tomogram
with non-zero voxel values in the "mask" tomogram will be considered,
and these remaining voxels will be multiplied by the mask's voxel value
before filtering.
(Usually every voxel in the mask tomogram is a number between 0 and 1.)
 This allows you to use soft masks with gradual boundaries.)
(This can be overridden using the
["-mask-select"](#-mask-select-intensity_value)
argument.)
*(Note:
 Certain filters like "-gauss", which have unit norm, will rescale the result of
 the filter by the sum of the mask values in the region considered.)*


### -mask-out brightness

If the "-mask-out" argument is specified, then voxels outside the mask will be
assigned to a brightness of *brightness* in the final output image generated
by *filter_mrc*.  If unspecified, these voxels will end up with a
brightness of 0 by default.


### -mask-select intensity_value

If the "-mask-select" argument is specified, then instead of considering all
voxels with non-zero values from the "mask" image,
only voxels whose mask intensity equals the number following
this argument will belong to the mask.
All other voxels will be ignored during filtering.

***NOTE FOR IMOD USERS:***
Some MRC files use signed bytes.
This is a problem because for these files
because IMOD reports all voxel brightnesses
in the range from 0-255 instead of -128-127.
This means that if IMOD reports that a voxel
has brightness of "1", (for example),
the true brightness stored in the file might be -127.
In that case using "-mask-select 1" will fail.
No other software I know does this.
You can tell if your MASK image file potentially has this problem
by using IMOD's "header" program, for example:
```
   header mask_file.rec
```
If the "Map mode" reported by "header" equals 0
then I suggest that you should convert the file
to a floating-point MRC format before using it with this software.
One way to do this is to use the
"convert_to_float" program (distributed with visfd):
```
   convert_to_float mask_file.rec new_file.rec
```
(If you prefer, you can also use IMOD's "newstack" program:
 "newstack -input mask_file.rec -output new_file.rec -mode 2")
Either way, this insures that the brightnesses in the "new_file.rec"
will be interpreted the same way in IMOD and other programs.
*Afterwards, if IMOD says that a particular voxel in this file
("new_file.rec") has value "1", then you can safely use "-mask-select 1"*


### -mask-rect xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax

You can can use the "**-mask-rect**" argument to define one or more rectangular
regions in space that will be used as a *mask* in later operations.
(Masks are used to ignore certain voxels during detection
and filter operations).  This is an alternative to using
the ["**-mask**"](#-mask-MRC_FILE) argument.
(It can also be used in *addition* to the "-mask" argument.)
The rectangle is bounded by the 6 numeric arguments:
*xmin*, *xmax*, *ymin*, *ymax*, *zmin*, and *zmax*.
Voxels *outside* this rectangle will be *ignored*,
and voxels *within* this rectangle will *not*.

This command can be issued *multiple times*, along with the
[-mask-rect-subtract](#-mask-rect-subtract-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax),
[-mask-sphere](#-mask-sphere-x0-y0-z0-r), and
[-mask-sphere-subtract](#-mask-sphere-subtract-x0-y0-z0-r)
commands to define complex regions in space.
The resulting mask region can be visualized using the
[-fill](#-fill-brightness) argument.

*Note:*
By default, the *xmin*, *xmax*, *ymin*, *ymax*, *zmin*, and *zmax*
positions are in units of *voxels* (**not** physical distance).
If you want to specify the rectangle coordinates in units of *physical distance*
(for example, in Angstroms), then add these two arguments to the argument list:
the "**-mask-crds-units distance**" (where **distance** is the word "distance",
not a number).

Note: If you are using IMOD to locate voxel coordinates,
       keep in mind that IMOD uses
      "1-indexing".  This means that it
      prints voxel coordinates starting at (1,1,1)
      instead of (0,0,0)
      In this program, voxel coordinates begin at (0,0,0).


### -mask-rect-subtract xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax

This command can be used to *remove* the voxels in a existing mask
which belong to a rectangular region bounded by the 6 numeric arguments: 
*xmin*, *xmax*, *ymin*, *ymax*, *zmin*, and *zmax*.
This command can be issued multiple times as part of an ordered chain of
[-mask](#-mask-MRC_FILE),
[-mask-rect](#-mask-rect-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax),
[-mask-sphere](#-mask-sphere-x0-y0-z0-r), and
[-mask-sphere-subtract](#-mask-sphere-subtract-x0-y0-z0-r)
commands which collectively define complex regions in space.
*(Note: This argument should not come before the
"-mask", "-mask-rect", or "-mask-sphere" arguments.)*
The resulting mask region can be visualized using the
[-fill](#-fill-brightness) argument.



### -mask-sphere x0 y0 z0 r

You can can use the "**-mask-sphere**" argument to define one or more spherical
regions in space that will be used as a *mask* in later operations.
This is an alternative to using
the ["**-mask**"](#-mask-MRC_FILE) argument.
(It can also be used in *addition* to the "-mask" argument.)
The *x0*, *y0*, *z0*, and *r* arguments specify the position of the sphere's
center and its radius, respectively.
Voxels *outside* the sphere will be *ignored*,
and voxels *within* this sphere will *not*.

This command can be issued *multiple times*, along with the
[-mask-sphere-subtract](#-mask-sphere-subtract-x0-y0-z0-r), and
[-mask-rect](#-mask-rect-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax),
[-mask-rect-subtract](#-mask-rect-subtract-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax),
commands to define complex regions in space.
The resulting mask region can be visualized using the
[-fill](#-fill-brightness) argument.

*Note:*
By default, the *x0*, *y0*, *z0*, and *r*
positions are in units of *voxels* (**not** physical distance).
If you want to specify the rectangle coordinates in units of *physical distance*
(for example, in Angstroms), then add these two arguments to the argument list:
the "**-mask-crds-units distance**" (where **distance** is the word "distance",
not a number).


### -mask-sphere-subtract x0 y0 z0 r

This command can be used to *remove* the voxels in a existing mask which
belong to a spherical region centered at *x0*, *y0*, *z0*, with radius *r*.
This command can be issued multiple times as part of an ordered chain of
[-mask](#-mask-MRC_FILE),
[-mask-sphere](#-mask-sphere-x0-y0-z0-r), and
[-mask-rect](#-mask-rect-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax),
[-mask-rect-subtract](#-mask-rect-subtract-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax),
commands which collectively define complex regions in space.
*(Note: This argument should not come before the
"-mask", "-mask-rect", or "-mask-sphere" arguments.)*
The resulting mask region can be visualized using the
[-fill](#-fill-brightness) argument.


### -fill brightness

Replace all of the voxel brightnesses in the image with *brightness*.
If a mask is in use, then voxels outside the mask will be omitted.
*(You can specify the brightness of these voxels outside the mask using the
[-mask-out](#-mask-out-intensity_value) argument, which is 0 by default.)*

If you use "**-fill 1**", this will generate a 3-D image showing where the
mask region is located.  (This can be useful if you are using the
[-mask-sphere](#-mask-sphere-x0-y0-z0-r) and
[-mask-rect](#-mask-rect-xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax) arguments.
You can view this image in IMOD, for example.)




## Miscellaneous

### -np  num_processors
  Specify the number of processors to use during the calculation.
  (By default this is the typically number of cores of your CPU,
   including hyperthreaded cores.)
  This argument is not available if you did not compile the program
  to enable support for OpenMP.


### Filter Size
```
   -truncate-threshold threshold
```
This specifies the number of voxels in the filter which will be convolved
with the image.
The filter window width is extended in the X, Y, and Z directions until
the filter intensity decays to less than **threshold** (a fraction),
compared to its peak value.
(For Difference-of-Gaussian filters, both Gaussians must decay to this value.)
If unspecified, this parameter is set to 0.02.
(This overrides the "-truncate-ratio" argument.)

```
   -truncate Wx Wy Wz
```
This argument specifies the size of the 3-D filter box in x,y, directions
(in units of the **a** and **b** distance parameters, or **Ïƒ** ("sigma")
 parameters which appear in the formulas above).
(This overrides the "-truncate-threshold threshold" argument, if also present.)

*(Note: Incidentally, the product of these 3 numbers, Wx*Wy*Wz, is proportional to the running time of the filter.
However when using the "-gauss" or "-gdog" filters with default exponent settings,
the running time is proportional to the sum of these numbers, Wx+Wy+Wz.
Keep this in mind when specifying filter window widths.)*


### -normalize-filters yes/no
When a Gaussian blur filter is applied to an image, each resulting voxel has
a brightness which is a (weighted) average of the brightnesses of nearby voxels.
By default, voxels which are *outside* the boundaries of the image
(or outside the *mask*), will not be included in this average.
Averaging is only done over the voxels which *are* within
the boundaries.  *(In other words, the weights given to the remaining voxels
are increased when computing the average nearby brightness.)*
Unfortunately, by averaging fewer voxels near the image boundaries,
the resulting image is likely to be noiser at these locations.
If this is not what you want, you can turn this feature off using
```
-normalize-filters no
```
If you do that, the image may appear artificially dark or bright
near the image or mask boundaries.

This setting effects the "-gauss" and "-ggauss" arguments.
It also effects blob detection, surface detection, curve detection,
and any other filters which apply a Gaussian blur to the image
at some point during the calculation.


### Distance Units: Angstroms or Nanometers
```
   -a2nm
```
When reading MRC files, this argument will
multiply the voxel width
specified in the MRC file by 0.1.
This allows you to specify your distance parameters in units of nm
instead of Angstroms.
(The voxel width in most tomograms is in Angstroms by default.)

This argument has no effect if the "-w" argument is used.



### -distance-points  coordinate_file

The **-distance-points** argument reads a file containing a list of 3D
coordinates and generates an image whose voxel intensities equal
the *distance* to the nearest point.
(This should not be confused with the
 [distance transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_transform).
 The size of the image matches the size of the image
 specified with the the "**-in**" argument.
 The points should lie within the boundaries of the image.)
Example:

```
   -distance-points coordinates.txt
```
The file should contain at least 3 numbers per line
(the x,y,z coordinates of that point, one point per line).
The x,y,z coordinates are assumed to be in physical units
(ie Angstroms) not voxels, *unless* the
["**-w 1**"](#Voxel-Width)
argument was also used.
*(WARNING: As of 2019-1-11, the calculation is quite slow.
  I've been too lazy to bother optimizing this for speed.)*


### -dogg
*Depreciation warning: This type of filter is unlikely to be useful
                       and may be removed in the future.*

If the **-dogg** or **-dogg-aniso* arguments are selected,
then the image will instead be convolved with the following function:
```
  h(x,y,z) = A*exp(-r_a^m) - B*exp(-r_b^n)
   where r_a = âˆš((x/a_x)^2 + (y/a_y)^2 + (z/a_z)^2))
     and r_b = âˆš((x/b_x)^2 + (y/b_y)^2 + (z/b_z)^2))
```
The width of the Gaussian (the a_x, a_y, a_z, b_x, b_y, b_z arguments) should be specified in units of physical distance, not in voxels.
The A and B coefficients will be automatically chosen
so that each Gaussian is normalized.
(The sum of h(x,y,z) over x,y,z is 0.
 The sum of the A and B terms over x,y,z is 1.)
The filter is truncated far away from the central peak at a point which is chosen automatically according the shape of the filter selected by the user.  However this can be customized using the
["**-truncate-threshold**"](#Filter-Size)
and
["**-truncate**"](#Filter-Size)
arguments if necessary (see below).
![A comparison of Difference-of-Generalized-Gaussians filter weights](./images/example_dogxy_w=2.516nm_a=13nm_b=20nm_m=2_n=2__vs__m=6_n=16.svg)
```
   filter_mrc -w 25.16 -dog 130 200 -exponents 2 2
   filter_mrc -w 25.16 -dog 130 200 -exponents 6 16
```
By default **m** *=* **n** *= 2*,
however this can be overridden using the optional "**-exponents m n**"
(For your convenience, you can plot these functions for various parameters
using the "draw_filter1D.py -dogg A B a b m n" python script which is
located in the same directory.
In this case, the "a" and "b" parameters should be specified in voxels, not physical distance.)
*Note:* that these *a*, *a_x*, *a_y*, *a_z*,
and *b*, *b_x*, *b_y*, and *b_z* parameters are a factor
of *âˆš2 times larger* than the corresponding *Ïƒ* ("sigma") parameter
traditionally used in the
[Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).
*Note:* The calculation is
[fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_filter)
if you use the default exponent of 2.
*Changing the exponents will slow down the filter considerably.*




####  Implementation of LoG filters and blob-detectors

To speed up the calculation,
the Difference-of-Gaussian approximation to the
(*scale-normalized*) Laplacian-of-Gaussian
filter us used.
Specifically, this filter has been approximated
[Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_difference_of_Gaussians_approach)
filter, *h(x,y,z)*
```
   h(x,y,z) = scale * ( A*exp(-0.5*r_a^2) - B*exp(-0.5*r_b^2) )
  where r_a = âˆš((x/a_x)^2 + (y/a_y)^2 + (z/a_z)^2))
    and r_b = âˆš((x/b_x)^2 + (y/b_y)^2 + (z/b_z)^2))
      a_x = Ïƒ_x*(1-0.5*Î´), a_y = Ïƒ_y*(1-0.5*Î´), a_z = Ïƒ_z*(1-0.5*Î´)
      b_x = Ïƒ_x*(1+0.5*Î´), b_y = Ïƒ_y*(1+0.5*Î´), b_z = Ïƒ_z*(1+0.5*Î´)
    scale = (1.0 / Ïƒ^2)
```
The A and B parameters are determined automatically by normalization.
The "*Î´*" parameter is *0.02* by default.
(This can be overridden using the
"-dog-delta Î´"
argument.
A smaller "*Î´*" value may improve the approximation,
but may also result in a noisier filtered image.)
As always, the width of the Gaussian (the *Ïƒ_x*, *Ïƒ_y*, *Ïƒ_z* arguments) should be specified in units of physical distance, not in voxels.
The *A* and *B* coefficients will be automatically chosen using normalization
(so that the discrete integral sums of *exp(-0.5*r_a^2)* and *exp(-0.5*r_b^2)*
functions are both 1).
The filter is multiplied by (1.0 / Î´^2) to achieve *scale invariance*.
*("Scale invariance" means an object of width W filtered with a Gaussian
of width Ïƒ, receives the same score as an
object of width 2W filtered with a Gaussian of width *2Ïƒ*, for example.)
This also means that you can use the
"**-log**",  "**-log-r**", and "**-log-d**" arguments
to perform scale-free-blob-detection, *one Gaussian-width at a time,*
in such a way that that you can directly compare
the results of using different Gaussian-widths
(the same way they are compared when using
"**-blob**", "**-blob-r**", and "**-blob-s**").

In all versions, the filter is truncated far away from the central peak at a point which is chosen automatically according the shape of the filter selected by the user.  However this can be customized using the
["-truncate-threshold"](#Filter-Size) and
["-truncate"](#Filter-Size)
arguments if necessary (see below).

*Note:* The Gaussian "Ïƒ" arguments (*Ïƒ*, *Ïƒ_x*, *Ïƒ_y*, and *Ïƒ_z*)
and the *t* ("time") scaling parameter (traditionally used
in the scale-space literature), are related according to:
```
   Ïƒ^2 = t
```
