visfd
===========

## Volumetric Image toolkit for Simple Feature Detection

This is a C++ template library for 3D image processing
("[visfd.hpp](./lib/visfd/visfd.hpp)")
as well as reading & writing image files using the the MRC file format
("[mrc_simple.hpp](./lib/mrc_simple/mrc_simple.hpp)").
It is also a collection of stand-alone programs
which use this library
(including "[filter_mrc](./doc/doc_filter_mrc.md)",
 "[combine_mrc](./doc/doc_combine_mrc.md)",
 "[voxelize_mesh](./doc/doc_voxelize_mesh.md)",
 "[sum_voxels](./doc/doc_sum_voxels.md)",
 and
 "[pval_mrc](./doc/doc_pval_mrc.md)").
They are documented [here](./doc).
Multiprocessor support is implemented using
[OpenMP.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP)


## programs included with this repository:

After compilation, all programs will be located in the "*bin/*" subdirectory.  Here is a brief description of some of them:


## filter_mrc
![example: a slice through a tomogram with a visible nucleoid](./doc/images/nucleoid_example_Hylemonella_gracilis.jpg)
![example: red: scale-free-blob-detection ("-blobr"), blue: fluctuation-filter ("-fluct")](./doc/images/nucleoid_example_Hylemonella_gracilis__red_blob_detection__blue_fluctuation_filter.jpg)
![example: membrane reconstruction using tensor voting and PoissonRecon (after cleaning up with meshlab)](./doc/images/nucleoid_example_Hylemonella_gracilis_inner_membrane.jpg)

**filter_mrc** is a stand-alone program which uses many of the
features of the **visfd** library.
This program was intended to be used for automatic
[membrane (surface) detection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625523),
[surface closure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51149213/how-to-avoid-hole-filling-in-surface-reconstruction),
edge detection (*EXPERIMENTAL_2021-6-20*),
filament (curve) detection (*EXPERIMENTAL_2021-6-20*),
[scale-free blob-detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection),
and
[watershed segmentation](https://imagej.net/Classic_Watershed)
A list of detected objects can be sorted, merged into contiguous regions,
and saved to standard files for further analysis by 3rd party programs.
For example, detected surfaces can be saved to a mesh file (in .ply format).
These files can then be read by external programs
([*PoissonRecon*](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon),
[*meshlab*](http://www.meshlab.net), and
[*voxelize_mesh.py*](doc/doc_voxelize_mesh.md))
to generate smooth, connected, closed surface meshes
and create new segmented images.

*(filter_mrc can also be used as a crude 3D image editor,
erasing or drawing spherical features in the image.
Users can also apply simple filters to images, including
low-pass, high-pass,
thresholding, clipping,
brightness inversions,
fluctuations,
[generalized Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_normal_distribution#Version_1),
[DoG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians),
[LoG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian),
[Ridge-detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_detection),
and
[3D tensor voting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625523)
filters.)*

*(As of 2021-6-20, this program does not have a graphical user interface, so
tutorials explain how to use this software with IMOD and meshlab to display
results and choose parameters.)*

Documentation for this program is located
[here](./doc/doc_filter_mrc.md).
The source code for the filters used by this program
is located
[here](./lib/visfd/).
This program currently only supports the .mrc/.rec image file format.


## voxelize_mesh.py
**voxelize_mesh.py** is a program that finds the voxels in a volumetric
image that lie within the interior of a closed surface mesh.
It was intended for segmenting the interiors of membrane-bound
compartments in tomograms of cells.
The mesh files that this program reads are *typically* generated by
*filter_mrc* ([together with other tools](./doc/doc_filter_mrc.md#example-3)).
However it can read any standard PLY file containing a closed polyhedral mesh.
This program currently only supports the .mrc/.rec image file format.
Documentation for this program is located
[here](./doc/doc_voxelize_mesh.md).
**WARNING: This experimental program is very slow and currently requires
a very large amount of RAM.**


## combine_mrc
**combine_mrc** is a program for combining two volumetric images (i.e. tomograms, both of identical size) into one image/tomogram, using a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and thresholding operations.  These features can be used perform binary operations between two images (which are similar to "**and**", "**or**", and "**not**" operations.)
Documentation for this program is located
[here](./doc/doc_combine_mrc.md).

## histogram_mrc.py
**histogram_mrc.py** is a graphical python program which displays the
histogram of voxel intensities contained in an MRC file.
It can be useful when deciding what thresholds to use
with in the "**filter_mrc**" and "**combine_mrc**" programs.
Voxels and regions in the image can be excluded from consideration
by using the "-mask" and "-mask-select" arguments.
This software requires the *matplotlib* and *mrcfile* python modules
(both of which can be installed using pip).
Documentation for this program is located
[here](./doc/doc_histogram_mrc.md).

## sum_voxels
**sum_voxels** is a program for estimating volumes.
It is a simple program which
reads an MRC (.REC) file as an argument
and computes the sum of all the voxel intensities.
(Typically the voxel intensities are either 1 or 0.
 The resulting sums can be converted into volumes
 either by multiplying by the volume-per-voxel,
 or by specifying the voxel width using the "-w" argument,
 and including the "-volume" argument.)
For convenience, threshold operation can be applied
(using the "-thresh", "-thresh2", and "-thresh4" arguments)
so that the voxels intensities vary between 0 and 1
before the sum is calculated.
The sum can be restricted to certain regions
(by using the "-mask" and "-mask-select" arguments).
Documentation for this program is located
[here](./doc/doc_sum_voxels.md).


## pval_mrc
**pval_mrc** is a program for estimating the probability
that a cloud of points in an image is distributed randomly.
It looks for regions of high (or low) density in an image.
(The user can specify a *-mask* argument to perform the analysis
 in small, confined, irregularly-shaped subvolumes from a larger image.)
Documentation for this program is located
[here](./doc/doc_pval_mrc.md).


### Development Status: *alpha*

Program names, command line arguments, file names, and function names
(in the API) may change in the future.
Automated testing was added,
however as of 2020-12-15, some commits still (temporarily) break everything.
(...because I'm too lazy to use branch & merge.
 This usually gets fixed within 24 hours.
 If the build is failing, choose a previous commit.)

### Development Timeline: 2021

Work on this project was temporarily halted on 2019-7,
however I occasionally make small feature updates as I need them.
We hope to finish the remaining features
and submit a paper on this software in 2021.
Nevertheless, if you find a bug, please report it.  I will fix it.

## Compilation

## Linux:

    source setup_clang.sh
    make

(If you are not using the bash shell, enter "bash" into the terminal beforehand.)

#### Warning: Avoid the **g++** compiler
As of 2020-2-11, we have had better results
[using the **CLANG** compiler.](https://github.com/jewettaij/visfd/issues/2).
*(The problem with g++ seems to only appear when clustering voxels together
after membrane detection to form connected membrane surfaces.)*

#### Warning: Avoid the **-Ofast** compiler argument
As of 2020-2-11, we have had better results using
[**-O3 -ffast-math**](https://github.com/jewettaij/visfd/issues/6) instead.
(The problem with -Ofast seems to only appear during membrane detection.
 See [setup_clang.sh](setup_clang.sh) for a list of suggested compiler flags.)

*Note: This program has been carefully checked for memory errors using valgrind
and was found to be clean.  The issues mentioned above only occur when compiler
optimization flags like -Ofast are in use.*


## Windows:

It is recommended that you install the BASH shell environment on your computer, along with *clang* and *make*.  (If you decide to use a different compiler, modify the "setup_clang.sh" file accordingly.)  There are several ways to do that.

Perhaps the easiest way is to install
[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10),
***or***
[virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
(In the later case, you will also need to install a linux distribution,
preferably with a lightweight
desktop such as [xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org).)
Alternatively, you can try 
[Hyper-V](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/run-linux-hyper-v/)
or (if you have an older version of windows)
[CYGWIN](https://www.cygwin.com/).

WSL and virtualbox are virtual machines that allow you to run an
alternate operating system from within windows.
In this case that operating system is linux.  The BASH shell and the
compiler tools that you need can be easily installed from within in linux.
Both WSL and virtualbox also create an alternate filesystem inside windows
where the linux operating system is stored.  Software (like *visfd/filter_mrc*)
that you download and install there can access the files in that filesystem.
So you may need to copy your tomograms and otherf files to this fileystem
beforehand.  If you **are using WSL or WSL2**, then you should
[use caution when using windows programs to edit files stored there](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/do-not-change-linux-files-using-windows-apps-and-tools/).
This includes text editors, image editors, and tomography processing software
(such as IMOD).
One possible way to avoid problems is to try to restrict yourself to using
programs which you downloaded and installed directly from within the
WSL or WSL2 environment *(if possible)*.  In particular, a couple of the
features of the *filter_mrc* program require you to learn and use a
(unix-style) text editor.  (Word, Wordpad, and Notepad will not work.)
Popular text editors include **Atom**, **Sublime**, **Notepad++**,
and **VSCode**.  Older, non-graphical programs include **vim**, **emacs**,
**nano**, **ne**, and **jove**.
Again, it is a good idea to install and run such programs from within WSL,
not windows.



## Apple Mac:

*WARNING: The following procedure has not been tested.
 If you have a mac, please test this and let me know if it worked
 (or if something else worked).
 -andrew 2019-3-08*

First follow the instructions
[here](https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/post/omp-on-high-sierra/)
to install OpenMP support:

Then compile visfd using
```
    source setup_clang.sh
    make
```

If this doesn't work and you are desperate, you can try this instead:
```
    source alternate_compiler_settings/for_debugging_and_profiling/setup_gcc_dbg.sh
    make
```
*Unfortunately the resulting (already slow) program will run at least 20x slower.*


## Requirements:

**16GB** of RAM or higher is required.
(64GB is recommended.  For membrane detection,
 your RAM must exceed 11x the size of the tomogram that you are analyzing.
 The *voxelize_mesh.py* program requires even more memory.
 You can reduce the memory needed and computation time dramatically
 by cropping your tomogram.)

The CLANG compiler is strongly recommended.
([The clustering feature does not yet work with GCC.](https://github.com/jewettaij/visfd/issues/2))

Some programs
(such as "histogram_mrc.py" and "draw_filter_1D.py")
require python, along with the
"numpy", "matplotlib", and "mrcfile" modules.
(installable via "pip")

*Automatic membrane surface closure* (a.k.a. surface reconstruction) currently
requires "**PoissonRecon**" (an external program) which you can download
[here](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon).
